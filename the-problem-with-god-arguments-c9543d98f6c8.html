    <p>Atheists and theists alike have for centuries attempted to
debate the existence of God, desperately trying to reason out a
conclusive answer. The reality of this struck me while I was reading a
series of MIT lectures notes on arguments for and against the existence
of God.</p>
<p>The lecture notes are very well written(so well written in fact the lazy
student in me probably wouldn't have bothered going to the lectures, if
I had the pleasure of taking the course in question). The course does a
decent job of explaining concepts such as deductive and inductive
reasons and a few other philosophical instruments, but this isn't the
source of my concern.</p>
<p>question grates on whenever I hear it. Lets take a small village in
England, a shopkeeper has just been murdered and a crowd has formed
around the scene of the crime. The police chief arrives sirens blaring,
barges through the crowd, quickly scans the situation and declares "Did
Mayor Dave do it!?". Everyone sighs, the Mayor is always blamed in such
cases. No-one remembers why the Mayor is blamed, it's just what's done.
The police chief along with his detectives then spend night and day
logically deducing if Mayor Dave is in fact the culprit. They always
come up short.</p>
<p>The obvious problem here is the police chief has taken the entirely
wrong approach, simply by asking the wrong question. I hope you know
where I'm going here, but the obvious alternative is instead to declare
"Lets look at the evidence and follow where it takes us". Why is this
approach not the same for the creation of existence? Why have we taken
only one, just one of the infinite amount of concepts, entities,
processes, whatever and decided to blow all our time reasoning about
this perfect being? A giant dragon by the name of Bill created the
universe, discuss. Why is this not getting the equilavent levels of
academic debate as Did God do it?</p>
<p>The pointlessness of these discussions hit me when the MIT lecture
notes went into detail on the specifics of what theists and atheists are
reasoning about. Theists say God is Omnipotent, Omniscient and
Good(OOG), then the atheists spend time arguing that if this is the case
you can infer(eventually) that because there is evil God must not exist.
The theists respond with, ah but if the evils that occur were always
outweighed by the future good generated by the original evil act(and
this is guaranteed by God), then in essence the overall good is
maintained. My counter point here would be, if God guarantees all evils
are outdone by future good, isn't it our moral obligation to always be
evil? But, I'm not going to be sucked into this rubbish debate. The
atheists have lost even by stepping into the playing field. I think
we've all forgotten that invention of God(I'm going back as far as
Dionysus here), was infact to counter a sensible lifestyle, to say screw
you to logic and reason and let emotions run wild. Two thousand years
later and we've forgotten this, blowing valid time reasoning about
effectively an emotional revolt against reason. Let the theists produce
all the reasoned arguments they can think of for God and when the exact
same argument doesn't just as validly apply to Bill the giant Dragon or
the Flying Spaghetti Monster I'll step up and listen.</p>
<p>Until then I applaud science and philosophers for at least attempting
to produce valid reasons for the existence of the world around us. It's
an incredibly slow process, but at least it's in the right direction.
One that's lately caught my attention is the `Anthropic
principle.</p>
