<p>For a while now vim has been my editor of choice and only up until
recently have I began to unearth it's potential. My reasoning before was
that it was so cross-compatible(even working in ssh terminals) that this
would always be my go-to editor. Now it's become so much more! Running
regexes across all working files with bufdo, crazy window manipulation
and crazy editing tricks have made this editor truly fantastic. I've
started using wherever possible, even trying out the vimperator firefox
plugin.</p>
<p>3 reasons to learn Vim are</p>
<p>1. Edit text far more efficiently(I as a programmer do this more than a
little)</p>
<p>2. Not look like an idiot by saying you "know" vim then head straight
for the arrow keys</p>
<p>3. The ladies</p>
<p>I felt if I was ever going to learn it I would have to see someone use
it. Luckily I found a guy who clearly only has love for VIM. Before I
watched the videos I basically knew a couple of shortcuts but still used
the arrows key and 'i' to do 95% of my work. Things have changed
drastically since then.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Play with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch all of these <a href="http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-novice-tutorial-videos/">vim tutorials</a>, a guy who has likely changed me forever!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel free to use the mindmap I made, I find it easier to traverse
quickly over the flat cheatsheet(but that's just me)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll find yourself working at a slow pace(even slower than normal) but
fight through this as the productivity rewards are worth it!</p>
<p>Alsoit may be a little annoying but add these to your .vimrc to disable
the arrow keys, this helped me a lot in using the editor correctly.</p>
