    <p>I decided instead of springing for a monthly github payed account I'd
install git on a server and use a decent web interface that could be
easily installed.</p>
<p>So for this little guide I'm rocking ubuntu 10.04 with git and lighttpd
already installed.</p>
<p>It was a Goldilocks search for ease of installation vs web interfaces
usefulness. I tried a number of options, gitweb looked a little rough
for my liking and Gitorious and InDeferno were just an utter pain to
install. Eventually I came across gitalist and decided I would give it's
incredibly simple to installation go(http://www.gitalist.com/install/).
By simply following the directions I managed to get it running without
any thought. The problem was it was running on port 3000, I wanted it to
hook it into lighttpd and have it run under a subdomain.</p>
<p>Since Gitalist is built with the catalyst framework, I figured using a
lighttpd catalyst tutorial would do the job.</p>
<p>Firstly you need to install FCGI and FCGI Process Manager for perl, so</p>
<p>sudo cpan FCGI FCGI::ProcManager</p>
<p>Or on ubuntu I think you can use</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install libfcgi-perl libfcgi-procmanager-perl</p>
<p>Now attempt to execute this command</p>
<p>/var/www/gitalist/script/gitalist_fastcgi.pl —listen 127.0.0.1:55900 —nproc 5</p>
<p>If your ubuntu install is anything like mine a bunch of errors with get
thrown in relation is FCGI.pm(And the proc manager) not being found. If
you do, run a locate for FCGI.pm, find which folder it's under then make
sure the folder FCGI.pm is in is in perl's @INC variable(this list of
folders should have been printed out when the above command executed and
failed). Then add them to the @INC in gitalist.</p>
<p>So for me, I simply edited lib/Gitalist/Script/FastCGI.pm and added
these 2 lines.</p>
<p>&gt; push(@INC, "/usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.1/");</p>
<p>push(@INC, "/usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/");</p>
<p>Once these were added executing the gitalist_fastcgi.pl worked fine.
Next step was to hook everything into lighttpd.</p>
<p>&gt; $HTTP["host"] =~ "(^|.)git_repos.example.com$" {</p>
<p>fastcgi.server = (</p>
<p>"" =&gt; (</p>
<h1>the extension is empty because we want to match on any extension</h1>
<p>"127.0.0.1" =&gt; (</p>
<p>"host" =&gt; "127.0.0.1",</p>
<p>"port" =&gt; 55900,</p>
<p>"check-local" =&gt; "disable"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>),</p>
<h1>make sure these folders exist</h1>
<p>server.errorlog = "/var/log/lighttpd/gitalist/error.log"</p>
<p>accesslog.filename = "/var/log/lighttpd/gitalist/access.log"</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Give lighttpd a restart and it should all hopefully work just fine.</p>
