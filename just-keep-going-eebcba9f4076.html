    <p>Productivity has never been my strong point. I'm the ultimate
procrastinator. I will literally do anything other than the task at
hand. In fact this post is likely being written purely as I don't want
to study. But, the post itself is useful in it's function to push me
forward.</p>
<p>I've gotten attracted to a very simple idea of "Just keep going". In my
head I imagine the Terminator, after being blown to bits, still getting
up. I suffer from "Goldilocks procrastination", essentially everything
needs to be just right before anything can happen. On top of that
everything needs to remain perfect for me to maintain it. On paper it's
insanely obvious that this will fail, but a lesson that's taken me a
while to learn. If I don't have all the study materials or if I miss a
run during the week and boom, never again. What's the point?</p>
<p>So after a huge number of failures I'm moving onto my very light, very
simple "just keep going". No fancy todo list software, no complicated
GTD systems, no goal tracking software. Literally none of them have
worked for me, purely as I can't forgive myself for the small failures.
I want to wake up in the morning, pull out a notepad, write whatever
inspires me that day and do it. If I miss a run or am missing something
that's barely preventing me from doing my task, it's irrelevant. It's
the next opportunity that's important.</p>
<p>Although a few months in these are my overall goals for 2011</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Become an early riser</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce my possesions(50 or less)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weekly blog post here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donate more money and time to charity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempt a major philosophical write-up, with intention to apply for a Masters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a vegetarian</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a 10k(Yeah I'm unfit)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll expand on each of these as the weeks go on. I don't doubt that this
will be difficult, right now I hold down two jobs which sucks up a huge
amount of time, but by documenting how I'm progressing and the
techniques I use to maintain motivation and find time I hope it'll help
me and others.</p>
