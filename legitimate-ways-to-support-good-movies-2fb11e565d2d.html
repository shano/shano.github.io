<p>Recently I watched Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, after reading
through some of the Criterion info on Kurosawa I realised I'd watched a
bunch of his movies, I'm a huge fan of Seven Samurai.</p>
<p>The Criterion Collection is a wonderful distribution company and I'm a
huge fan of a number of their filmmakers, so much so that I wanted to
try and support the service more. Since I live fairly lightly in terms
of possessions I can't really justify $40 on a DVD or Blu-Ray.
Especially since I'll probably have moved elsewhere and be forced to
ditch the media before I can watch it a second time.
It's a shame when distribution companies haven't really adopted digital
distribution. I am aware that Criterion is on Hulu(now something else), but unfortunately as I'm not a US resident I can't access/support it. If you are and can access it, I highly recommend checking out some of their movies.</p>
<p>Luckily I found a more old-school method to (in some small way) support Criterion movies. Near to where I work is a wonderful film-center called Close-Up that has a huge collection of both DVDs and books to rent. I'll definitely be making use of it for the time being.
If you know of another way I can access the Criterion movies in the
EU(or just without a US credit-card), I'd love to know.</p>
