    <h3>Corkscrew</h3>
<p>What corkscrew does is allow you to tunnel ssh connections over a http
proxy very easily. As far as admins of the http proxy can see this is
encrypted traffic which is most likely anssl connection to a web
server(the server you have sshed to), you could in theory ( :D ), create
a socks proxy using an ssh tunnel that is corkscrewing over a http
proxy. Then set your browser to use that socks proxy instead of the http
proxy and thus encrypt all your traffic. I think you can use this with
windows and cygwin tool but its probably easier to simply use putty as
is has added support for this a while back.</p>
<h3>Tsocks</h3>
<p>This useful little command line app allows you to use the socks protocol
with applications that may or may not support socks proxies and does not
require you to have to configure all of your apps. So if you want to use
the Opera web browser over a socks proxy, which it annoyingly doesn't
support simply configure tsocks with your socks proxy and run "tsocks
opera". Tsocks has pretty much worked with every command I could throw
at it when I'm stuck behind an annoying proxy.</p>
<h3>Curlftpfs</h3>
<p>Another app to make life that little bit easier, if you're using a crap
cheapo web hosting service(like I currently am), one way to make your
life easier is to mount the ftp server locally and run all the commands
you want to on it using curlftp, so you don't need that fancy expensive
server with ssh access to run stuff, well unless you want to execute
something on the server… which you probably will, like I really do,
but i'll put up with this rather than paying triple what I am now for
hosting. :D. But Curlftp seems to work just as well as others remote
mounting such assshfs etc… I would recommend building from source, I
was using Ubuntu and the repos version didn't work.</p>
