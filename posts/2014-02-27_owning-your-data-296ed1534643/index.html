I use ovh. I’ll post up links each week on a new service or product that I’ve swapped across.\nHere’s what I’m currently using in terms of functional products.\nFacebook-Replaced by Ditching Facebook. Maybe use a blog instead? Try alternative communities? Tumblr-Wordpress for everything. Smartphone-I’ve now moved from a dumbphone to a Jolla Phone running Sailfish. It’s mostly open source and developed in Finland, more for the tech oriented(still a lot of bugs) but a great community helping to define Sailfish. They’re also looking to create a new Secure Sailfish operating system if you wanted to wait. Not perfect but sufficient. Twitter-Consider diaspora Gmail-Replace Gmail with your own mail server or fastmail is pretty nice. Google Calendar-Owncloud has a really nice calendar with caldav sync. Evernote/Google Keep-Personally I’m using the ownnotes plugin on owncloud but tagspaces looks really nice if you don’t want to use owncloud. Whatsapp-Difficult-They own all the contacts right now and they’ve sold those contacts to Facebook. I’m now using Signal and am trying to convince my friends/family to use it instead. Dropbox-I now use owncloud.It’s sync functionality is really nice. Highly recommended. Google Contacts-Owncloud again. The contacts app is decent has really nice carddav functionality. Skype-I’d suggest linphone with some like callwithus for VOIP services, they take bitcoin. Spotify-They require facebook to login which really isn’t great. Plus you don’t really own any of the content on there. Personally I think magnatune is a great alternative. Ogg formats you can download any time and half of all revenue goes to the artists. You could also host/stream your music purchases on your own server with ampache. Google Reader/Feedly-The ownnews plugin for owncloud. Pocket/Instapaper-Wallabag is a really nice self-hosted read it later webapp. Some good external links:\nPrism-Break The Guardian Project ","wordCount":"538","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-02-27_owning-your-data-296ed1534643/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
