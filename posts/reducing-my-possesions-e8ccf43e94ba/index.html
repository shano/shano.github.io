I also use a lot of study-aid books especially when reading weighty topics. As a result I still usually buy a copy of the book and download the study aid onto my kindle. So I am reducing my book intake and I still get to write to my hearts content! I do still intend to get rid of more books though, in the end I always try to retain the message of a book in a mindmap, so really keeping the book long after it’s been read is pointless. If I need to re-read a book I own I can grab a digital copy.\nBenefits Other than a pleasant feeling of lightness from minimising your possesions, you begin to value your purchasing decisions more. For example instead of thoughtless buying another video game that’d I never get around to playing, I sold my PS3 and picked up a small chess set and began to learn the more advanced aspects of the game. I’m enjoying it so much more. I value the longer term enjoyment from chess as opposed to the transient pleasure of video games. It’s something I’d never consider before attempting this 50 items system.\nAnother obvious benefit is my one in one out system, whereby I need to get rid of something on that list to replace what I’ve bought. As a result I spend far less and value what I have more. When you reflect seriously on what you spend you begin to notice how much excess we burden ourselves with. Upon realising this I decided to pick up a copy of The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer and after reading it I decided to take as much of the money I was needlessly spending and put it to charity. If you’re considering doing the same I’d stronly suggest checking out givewell a fantastic charity review site and the life you can save, they might just inspire you to do something very cool!\nTips/Tricks I’ve found that whilst I’ve managed to cut down on my superfluous items I always came across more useless junk. I’ve started place all these junk items on a shelf near the door, once I’d collected enough stuff I go to the charity shop or recycling depo and get rid of everything.
