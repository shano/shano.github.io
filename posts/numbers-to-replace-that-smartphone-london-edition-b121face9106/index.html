They’ll hold them for you till you show up. Also has a much better search engine than Amazons. “I need that book by that guy who’s on the panel show with the Irish guy” type conversations and the staff will still somehow manage to root out whatever the hell I’m talking about.

Here I’d recommend just calling someone. I’d rather have one conversation with a friend over the phone than a million likes from acquaintances.

I’m sure you could do something similar for your own city. I’ll maintain this list as I discover new numbers worth putting up. In particular I’m looking for a service to recommend events around the city, like a timeout magazine, but a phone number. I’m looking forward to seeing how far I can push this.\n","wordCount":"637","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2014-01-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2014-01-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/numbers-to-replace-that-smartphone-london-edition-b121face9106/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
