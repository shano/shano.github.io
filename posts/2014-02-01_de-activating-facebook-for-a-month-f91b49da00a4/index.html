I&rsquo;ll keep this one short, because there&rsquo;s a million and one articles about people walking away from the social network. People are writing like they&rsquo;re revolutionaries leading the mass exodus. I even poked fun at it in my internet predictions. Anyway, at the start of the year I figured I&rsquo;d give a month away from facebook a try, partially inspired by Leo Babuta&rsquo;s A Year of Living Without.
Why
I asked myself what value I was actually getting from the service. If I
can&rsquo;t be bothered ringing someone and catching up, then realistically
why would I waste time liking their cat photos? I also questioned the
value of these facebook friends. Am I actually friends with all these
people or is the connection just convenient enough for me to keep them
around? Do I actually want to share something with them or am I just
boasting?
Again, this topic has been discussed ad nauseam, but I&rsquo;ll link this article and quote it&rsquo;s final line, &ldquo;Direct interactions with other human beings led people to feel better&rdquo;. Again, the article is based on one study, but it adds evidence to a belief I&rsquo;ve held for quite some time."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-02-01_de-activating-facebook-for-a-month-f91b49da00a4/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-02-01_de-activating-facebook-for-a-month-f91b49da00a4/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-02-01_de-activating-facebook-for-a-month-f91b49da00a4/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="De-activating facebook for a month"><meta property="og:description" content="
