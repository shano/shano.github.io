I&rsquo;m happy to see the media dog-piling on Facebook so much lately. None of this &rsquo;news&rsquo; seems to actually be conveying much that&rsquo;s new, more that it&rsquo;s started taking what was slowly becoming normalised and framed it in a way to highlight the outrage. I don&rsquo;t particularly like the media&rsquo;s approach but I can&rsquo;t feel too sorry about Facebook. We should be outraged with their on-going behaviour."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/backups/2018-03-26_four-years-without-facebook-7d5285a25913_20250730_155439/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/backups/2018-03-26_four-years-without-facebook-7d5285a25913_20250730_155439/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/backups/2018-03-26_four-years-without-facebook-7d5285a25913_20250730_155439/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:description" content="title: Four years without Facebook slug: four-years-without-facebook-7d5285a25913 date: 2018-03-26T18:06:17.553Z categories: [“Mindfulness”]
