So before you can move to your own self-hosted services, you&rsquo;ll need
your own hosting. This is a really basic tutorial/set of links on
getting a server up and running with Salt.
Hosting Provider
DigitalOcean is a terrific hosting company if you&rsquo;re want to play around with a few personal servers. Here&rsquo;s the pro&rsquo;s list.

It&rsquo;s really cost effective.
The UI is super basic.
They have great tutorials for beginners.

How safe is DigitalOcean?
Well, this is a call you&rsquo;ll need to make yourself. They are a New York
based hosting company so that&rsquo;s not so good. However, you can deploy
droplets(servers) in Amsterdam which CEO Ben Uretsky stated should make
snooping harder. It&rsquo;s hardly a ringing endorsement."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/owning-your-data-initial-server-setup-afa33394b94/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2211ca3164be7830024f6aad2b3a2e520843a64f8f048445c3401c1249aa051d.css integrity="sha256-IhHKMWS+eDACT2qtKzouUghDpk+PBIRFw0AcEkmqBR0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/owning-your-data-initial-server-setup-afa33394b94/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/owning-your-data-initial-server-setup-afa33394b94/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="Owning Your Data — Initial Server Setup"><meta property="og:description" content="
