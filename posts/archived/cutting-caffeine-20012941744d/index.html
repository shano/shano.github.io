A little while ago, I read a post on Sebastian Marshall&rsquo;s blog about cutting caffeine, in which goes into the benefits and a method he uses for quitting coffee. He suggests cycling off it to reset your tolerance every so often. I figured that was a really good idea since I&rsquo;d gotten to the
point where in the morning I needed a coffee to feel normal, it was a
good time to do something about it. Sebastian&rsquo;s method of taking caffeine pills I found a little extreme. There&rsquo;s a certain aesthetic to drinking coffee that I really enjoy and trying to replace it with green tea and pills wasn&rsquo;t going to work. Sebastian may have a mental strength I simply don&rsquo;t possess so I needed to offset the caffeine with altering the experience much."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/archived/cutting-caffeine-20012941744d/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/archived/cutting-caffeine-20012941744d/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/archived/cutting-caffeine-20012941744d/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="Cutting caffeine"><meta property="og:description" content="
