Secondly, it’s wonderful to watch your breath while you’re full of positive “I love life” energy but that’s not exactly reflective of my mood throughout the day and when your hope is to extend mindfulness to the rest of your day you want to develop an expectation that you’re only mindful when your very positive.\nNow, I do fully intend to use this ordering when I’m running low on ideas but I shall limit it only to then.
