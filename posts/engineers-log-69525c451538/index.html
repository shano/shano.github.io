Four years ago(to the day) I wrote a post on why I was Giving up on wikis and I have to admit, four years later my opinions on the topic really haven&rsquo;t changed.
It&rsquo;s been 4 years, 700 questions(with 800 answers) and several server
moves later and by and large the process hasn&rsquo;t changed all that much,
everything is just little more streamlined.

A lot of the time, I notice that a solution I’m entering is worthy of a blog post.

If I was writing rough documentation for a specific team I would create tags for them to review my “documents” while I was writing them up.

This solution always ended up getting messy to me so I moved them to my OSQA install. They’re much tidier up there personally, I drill-down into the scripts tag then filter with what I need.

One suggestion the book does it mark an X, every-time you use a solution from your Engineers Log. I want to eventually hack OSQA, so that I can use the Upvote feature myself to flag frequently used solutions. Eventually I’ll add pygments syntax highlighting. 4 years later and I still haven’t gotten round to it. I should probably migrate from an OSQA install to Askbot, considering there doesn’t seem to be much of an open source future but my current solution works just fine so I see no need. That’s about it really, to be honest the lesson here really is that flexible solutions last.\n","wordCount":"459","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2014-06-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2014-06-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/engineers-log-69525c451538/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
