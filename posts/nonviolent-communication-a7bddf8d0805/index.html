What is Nonviolent Communication?
Nonviolent Communication(NVC) helps us communicate clearly by breaking down and identifying our needs and communicating them compassionately.
Why?
NVC can help reduce conflict towards others and ourselves. It can also help us to hear others out and recognise each other&rsquo;s needs and support acting more compassionately day to day.
How
At a high level, the steps involved are:
Observation
Be present and listen carefully to what the other person is saying. How is it affecting you?

Express yourself with positive language. Ask for something, don’t frame the request as something to stop being done.\nAvoid “You are always X” Use language like “I would like….” Listening As a bonus, you can also use NVC when you are listening.\nObservation-Give the person space to fully express their feelings. Feeling-Don’t jump to offer advice. Ask questions and help the other person evaluate and understand their feelings. Needs-Use the power of reflection. Rephrase what the other person is saying back to them, sometimes what they communicate might not be what they actually need. Request-Confirm and clarify the request after establishing what the need is. Ensure it’s clearly understood. Behaviours There are also behaviours to be mindful of when practising NVC.\nTake responsibility for your feelings. Your reaction to life events determines how you feel, not the event itself. When reacting to conflict, avoid defensive/negative reactions, neither get to the root of the issue. Talk through your own feelings and use the process to identify your emotional response and address the reasons for the conflict. Use NVC to reduce self-judgement. Listen to your judgement and instead of being led by those feelings, ask yourself, “what unmet needs am I expressing here?” ","wordCount":"370","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-08-27T13:32:59.35Z","dateModified":"2021-08-27T13:32:59.35Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/nonviolent-communication-a7bddf8d0805/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
