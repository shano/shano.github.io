SugarCRM has some neat features involving currency rates, but one of the
more annoying ones is that Sugar will automatically update the base rate
every time you save a record with a currency field attached. This can be
fairly annoying default behaviour if you wish to maintain the correct
record value at the time of sale.
The problem
Say for example you have a custom module Books and your systems base
currency is USD. You sell a book for 10 Euros at 11 dollars(the currenct
change rate). If say a few weeks later you wanted to change the status
of the Book to say, note down that the invoice was received and the
exchange rate in that time has changed drastically. When you hit save
Sugar would re-calculate the Euro value again(and despite the item being
sold for 10 Euros originally the exchange rate has now changed and Sugar
shows say 12 Euros, which is completely inconsistent with what you&rsquo;ve
invoiced."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/sugarcrm-prevent-currencies-getting-overridden-7944af907da9/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2211ca3164be7830024f6aad2b3a2e520843a64f8f048445c3401c1249aa051d.css integrity="sha256-IhHKMWS+eDACT2qtKzouUghDpk+PBIRFw0AcEkmqBR0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/sugarcrm-prevent-currencies-getting-overridden-7944af907da9/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script src="https://brightpin.com/script.js?v=1" data-site=f93d4c22-b475-476d-8d86-8ec34fffe005 data-endpoint=https://brightpin.com/collect async></script><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/sugarcrm-prevent-currencies-getting-overridden-7944af907da9/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="SugarCRM — Prevent currencies getting overridden"><meta property="og:description" content="

So taking our book example this is what custom/modules/Books/logic_hooks.php might look like.\n\u003c?php // Do not store anything in this file that is not part of the array or the hook version. This file will // be automatically rebuilt in the future. $hook_version = 1; $hook_array = Array(); // position, file, function $hook_array['before_save'] = Array(); $hook_array['before_save'][] = Array(1, 'workflow', 'include/workflow/WorkFlowHandler.php','WorkFlowHandler', 'WorkFlowHandler'); $hook_array['before_save'][] = Array(2, 'Custom Book Logic Hooks', 'custom/modules/Books/logic_hooks_class.php','books_logic_hooks', 'before_save_method'); $hook_array['after_save'][] = Array(1, 'Custom Book Logic Hooks', 'custom/modules/Books/logic_hooks_class.php','books_logic_hooks', 'after_save_method'); ?\u003e And the actual code to do the overriding would be in custom/modules/Books/logic_hooks_class.php\n\u003c?php if (!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) die('Not A Valid Entry Point'); class books_logic_hooks { protected static $fetchedRow; function before_save_method(\u0026$bean, $event, $arguments) { if (!empty($bean-\u003eid)) { self::$fetchedRow[$bean-\u003eid] = $bean-\u003efetched_row; } } /** * Called as process_record logic hook on the Books module */ /** * [@param](http://twitter.com/param \"Twitter profile for @param\") $bean * [@param](http://twitter.com/param \"Twitter profile for @param\") $event * [@param](http://twitter.com/param \"Twitter profile for @param\") $arguments */ function after_save_method(\u0026$bean, $event, $arguments) { $custom_bean = new Books(); $custom_bean-\u003eretrieve($bean-\u003eid); $resave_bean = false; // Need to ignore base rate updates when the currency stays the same if (isset(self::$fetchedRow[$custom_bean-\u003eid]['currency_id']) \u0026\u0026 self::$fetchedRow[$custom_bean-\u003eid]['currency_id'] == $bean-\u003efetched_row['currency_id'] ) { if (isset(self::$fetchedRow[$custom_bean-\u003eid]['base_rate']) \u0026\u0026 self::$fetchedRow[$custom_bean-\u003eid]['base_rate'] != $bean-\u003efetched_row['base_rate']) { // Run a SQL update to reset the base price to the original, as it shouldn't be over-ridden unless it's new $sql = sprintf('UPDATE books_cstm SET base_rate=\"%s\" WHERE id_c=\"%s\";', self::$fetchedRow[$custom_bean-\u003eid]['base_rate'], $custom_bean-\u003eid); $bean-\u003edb-\u003equery($sql); } } } } Using the db over-ride hack should allow you to retain the same base rate on each record and Sugar will display the original 10 Euros despite the exchange rate changing.\nSome words of caution If you decide to override Sugar’s default behaviour, you could run into some issues down the line with reporting. Basically the reports modules seems to ignore the base rate stored on each individual record and just uses whatever the system default is.\nSo you’ll have totals in your report that will be inconsistent with the currency value that’s stored on the record. One way around this is to only create reports using your base currency, another is to create a secondary field storing the correct amount of the currency in a decimal field rather than a currency field and creating reports based on that amount.\n","wordCount":"551","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2015-04-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/sugarcrm-prevent-currencies-getting-overridden-7944af907da9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://shanedowling.com/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">SugarCRM — Prevent currencies getting overridden</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2015-04-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>April 16, 2015</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Shane Dowling</div></header><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/1__zrzOG7L4xvFI2XJ2hB9iaA.jpeg></p><p>SugarCRM has some neat features involving currency rates, but one of the

rate on each record and Sugar will display the original 10 Euros despite
the exchange rate changing.</p><h3 id=some-words-of-caution>Some words of caution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#some-words-of-caution>#</a></h3><p>If you decide to override Sugar&rsquo;s default behaviour, you could run
into some issues down the line with reporting.
Basically the reports modules seems to ignore the base rate stored on
each individual record and just uses whatever the system default is.</p><p>So you&rsquo;ll have totals in your report that will be inconsistent with the
currency value that&rsquo;s stored on the record. One way around this is to
only create reports using your base currency, another is to create a
secondary field storing the correct amount of the currency in a decimal
field rather than a currency field and creating reports based on that
amount.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://shanedowling.com/>Shane Dowling</a></span> ·
