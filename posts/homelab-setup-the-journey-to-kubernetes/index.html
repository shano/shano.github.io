<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Why I&rsquo;m Migrating My Self-Hosted Services
I&rsquo;ve decided to migrate all my existing self-hosted services—and add a few new ones—to a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster that I&rsquo;m going to build. There are several motivations behind this decision:
Learning Kubernetes Beyond Ephemeral Clusters

My role as an Engineering Manager at Syntasso involves a lot of K8s development using Kind, but these environments are entirely ephemeral. I want to experience the long-term challenges of operating a cluster to build greater empathy for our customers.
I want to deepen my understanding of Kubernetes, particularly in areas like:

Hardening a K8s cluster
Managing multiple clusters effectively



Increased Focus on Self-Hosting

The British government&rsquo;s baffling approach to tech privacy has pushed me toward self-hosting more of my personal services.
My current setup is a mix of manually configured systems and Docker Compose-based services running on different machines. It’s time to bring structure to the chaos.

The Plan
Time Constraints and Approach

Minimising downtime—I already have services running that I need to migrate carefully without disruptions. Migration Phases The migration will be broken down into multiple phases to ensure a smooth transition. My current focus is on:\nSetting up RAID storage for critical data (Nextcloud, Git-Tea, Pixelfed, databases) on an old laptop. Keeping USB media drives on a thin client until I migrate services to Kubernetes. Moving USB media drives to a MergerFS pool for media storage before the final migration. Building a Kubernetes cluster (Talos OS) once storage is stable. Migrating services from Docker Compose to Kubernetes with proper storage integration. Rough Architecture At the moment, everything will sit under the same LAN at home. However, as I progress, I may invest in a switch and introduce proper network segmentation.\nThis is just the beginning. I’ll document my learnings, mistakes, and adjustments along the way.
