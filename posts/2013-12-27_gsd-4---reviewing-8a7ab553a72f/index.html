I look to see if there are appropriate alterations I can use to help improve. Here’s a list of the things I tend to analyse while reviewing, and the questions I’ve asked.\nRescueTime - What have I procrastinated on this week? What peak times do I tend to be productive on my computer and when are the troughs? Can I replace this behavior with something slightly more useful? Habit Streak - This one I find very important. What habits have I maintained and what have failed? I ask myself in a gentle self-analytical way why I couldn’t maintain certain habits and what conditions I can change to improve my chances. Maybe the habits are simply not maintainable? Do I need to stop others and make specific time for new ones? Should I change my schedule? Reviewing is key to maintaining habits like these and the app I use is really straight-forward, exactly what I need. Sleep as Android— Am I still maintaining a good sleep habit? Sometimes I try alterations to my routine and work out if there’s a positive or negative effect to my day. Todo List -I just use a notepad and sometimes just dump ideas into Evernote. At the end of the week I collect them up and add them to a todo list or ditch them. Saying no and not indulging ideas you simply don’t have time for it key to this. Instapaper - I do some gardening to my reading list and dump anything I felt may have been a valuable read at the time but on reflection isn’t. I have a tendency to throw everything and the kitchen sink at my reading list, so purging this down is essential. Gratefulness - I add in the things that I’m grateful for from the last week. Typically I try write these moments down during the week. It helps to re-affirm the things you find important and appreciate. By doing it and keeping the things you’re grateful for in your mind it helps the review become a more decisive and straightforward process, especially when you have a tendency to hang on to those ideas or wandering thoughts that really have no value. Projects - What progress have I made in the last week? How has it stacked up compared to other weeks? Did I have a fluid week or was there blockers, how can I approach these if they occur again? Contacts - Are there contacts or people I’ve met recently that I wish to catch up or meet again? Generally this is a rough list of what I look at and I’ve found the process very revealing and incredibly useful. It provides me with a framework that has kept me focused on my longer-term goals but also on my general health and how I can potentially make systematic improvements in smaller ways on a regular basis. These improvements will accrue and the benefits over time can be phenomenal.\n","wordCount":"533","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2013-12-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2013-12-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/2013-12-27_gsd-4---reviewing-8a7ab553a72f/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
