If so, it could be a DNS issue.\nMySQL\nwatch -n 1 mysqladmin — user=mysql_user — password=mysql_password processlist -\u003e This command will watch live mysql queries being executed. Noticing any crap queries running insanely long? This could be your issue.\nAnd directly related to slow crap queries do you have an large tables that say might be causing a serious performance issue? Here’s a mysql query to grab the largest tables on your server.\nSELECT CONCAT(table_schema, '.', table_name), CONCAT(ROUND(table_rows / 1000000, 2), 'M') rows, CONCAT(ROUND(data_length / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 ), 2), 'G') DATA, CONCAT(ROUND(index_length / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 ), 2), 'G') idx, CONCAT(ROUND(( data_length + index_length ) / ( 1024 * 1024 * 1024 ), 2), 'G') total_size, ROUND(index_length / data_length, 2) idxfrac FROM information_schema.TABLES ORDER BY data_length + index_length DESC LIMIT 10; Index your tables better or truncate crap you don’t need.\nApache\nps ax | grep apache | wc -l Let’s assume you didn’t change your ubuntu default apache configuration, if your MaxChild setting is at 150 and the value returned from the above command is stuck at over 150(wc will match the ps command too), then here’s your problem. It may “look” like your network is slow but in fact it’s apache being forced to queue requests.\nRun ps aux | grep apache and see how much ram apache is taking on your server(you should see roughly what each concurrent connection is getting in terms of ram percentage). Do some math and see if you have the free ram to increase max childs, if you can, do so.\nIf not, reduce the keepalive value(essentially this isn’t as scary as it sounds, quite a few major sites run without a keepalive value at all), but this entirely depends on your sites usage. Altering keepalive will lose you some speed, you’re essentially cycling through the concurrent requests faster, so request 151 doesn’t have to wait as long. But, you need to decide whether less speed for more people is better than speed with a hard concurrent limit.\nYou can also enable some of apache’s new cleverer keepalive modules but again that goes beyond the scope of the post.\n","wordCount":"665","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2012-04-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2012-04-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/screwed-server-checklist-ef23820824c7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://shanedowling.com/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Screwed Server Checklist</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2012-04-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>April 28, 2012</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Shane Dowling</div></header><div class=post-content><p>My servers started getting unusably slow at peak hours lately and I
