Governments are collecting data on you, that&rsquo;s a fairly accepted fact at this stage. Whether you&rsquo;re being &ldquo;social&rdquo;, reading email, playing video games or even when you&rsquo;re writing a book on the NSA. If you want more details The Guardian has a great explanation as to what Snowden&rsquo;s files mean here.
There&rsquo;s one critical flaw to the NSA&rsquo;s methods. Most of how the NSA collects data on you(via prism anyway) is through Google, Yahoo, Gmail, Facebook and Microsoft. These technologies are all just choices you&rsquo;ve made. Thankfully, choices you can undo."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/owning-your-data-296ed1534643/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2211ca3164be7830024f6aad2b3a2e520843a64f8f048445c3401c1249aa051d.css integrity="sha256-IhHKMWS+eDACT2qtKzouUghDpk+PBIRFw0AcEkmqBR0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/owning-your-data-296ed1534643/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/owning-your-data-296ed1534643/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="Owning Your Data"><meta property="og:description" content="

If you’re not too technical and want to get up and running with owncloud, checkout Bitnami’s owncloud stack, with a one-click installer, though I’d try avoid those hosting platforms and go for something based in Europe. I use ovh. I’ll post up links each week on a new service or product that I’ve swapped across.\nHere’s what I’m currently using in terms of functional products.\nFacebook-Replaced by Ditching Facebook. Maybe use a blog instead? Try alternative communities? Tumblr-Wordpress for everything. Smartphone-I’ve now moved from a dumbphone to a Jolla Phone running Sailfish. It’s mostly open source and developed in Finland, more for the tech oriented(still a lot of bugs) but a great community helping to define Sailfish. They’re also looking to create a new Secure Sailfish operating system if you wanted to wait. Not perfect but sufficient. Twitter-Consider diaspora Gmail-Replace Gmail with your own mail server or fastmail is pretty nice. Google Calendar-Owncloud has a really nice calendar with caldav sync. Evernote/Google Keep-Personally I’m using the ownnotes plugin on owncloud but tagspaces looks really nice if you don’t want to use owncloud. Whatsapp-Difficult-They own all the contacts right now and they’ve sold those contacts to Facebook. I’m now using Signal and am trying to convince my friends/family to use it instead. Dropbox-I now use owncloud.It’s sync functionality is really nice. Highly recommended. Google Contacts-Owncloud again. The contacts app is decent has really nice carddav functionality. Skype-I’d suggest linphone with some like callwithus for VOIP services, they take bitcoin. Spotify-They require facebook to login which really isn’t great. Plus you don’t really own any of the content on there. Personally I think magnatune is a great alternative. Ogg formats you can download any time and half of all revenue goes to the artists. You could also host/stream your music purchases on your own server with ampache. Google Reader/Feedly-The ownnews plugin for owncloud. Pocket/Instapaper-Wallabag is a really nice self-hosted read it later webapp. Some good external links:\nPrism-Break The Guardian Project ","wordCount":"538","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2014-02-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/owning-your-data-296ed1534643/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://shanedowling.com/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Owning Your Data</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2014-02-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 27, 2014</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Shane Dowling</div></header><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/1__onILu1exx9sSg4nwDK__CJw.jpeg></p><p>Governments are collecting data on you, that&rsquo;s a fairly accepted fact at this stage.
