What it does
Execute commands from google wave on your remote server.
How to set it up
You need python2.6 or greater, which sucks for a lot of debian users but I
need it to be able to kill processes nicely.
Fill in the details required here. Deploy it to your own google app engine deployment and continue on the easy option.
How it works
Using google wave&rsquo;s api and google&rsquo;s datastore, when a blip is submitted
an xmlrpc request is sent to your server, along with your hashed password for
authentication. The python code running on the server is then executed
as a sub process and the output is returned. If the server subprocess
lasts more than 3 seconds it is killed and that output is returned, I
can&rsquo;t seem to be able to wait any longer before the request times out."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/google-wave-server-admin-693186dcac55/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.2211ca3164be7830024f6aad2b3a2e520843a64f8f048445c3401c1249aa051d.css integrity="sha256-IhHKMWS+eDACT2qtKzouUghDpk+PBIRFw0AcEkmqBR0=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/google-wave-server-admin-693186dcac55/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/google-wave-server-admin-693186dcac55/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="Google Wave Server Admin"><meta property="og:description" content="
