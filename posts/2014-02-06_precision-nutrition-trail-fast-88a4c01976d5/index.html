I didn’t over-do it in terms of food. I often get hungrier the next morning if I eat a huge meal the night before.\n9 AM Saturday Ran a 10k. This is the part I’m a little apprehensive about. I’m doing a training program to build up to my next half marathon, which includes 10k-15k runs on Sundays. I’m always starving after a run(naturally), so I’m curious to know how my body will tackle this. I also figure if this is a trial fast I should trial it during real life conditions, which would regularly include running. 10 AM The post-run hunger has come over me, but the “breakfast” while not the most satisfying I’ve ever has taken the edge off. mL (1 cup) of green tea and 5 grams BCAA (branched chain amino acids) powder (or take 5 capsules). 1PM Hunger cravings are on the up causing me to feel a little tender, but short breathing exercise and keeping busy seem to help. 2PM I’ve been a vegetarian for over three years, why do I still imagine greasy burgers when I get hunger pains? Had a cigar to help things along. Is that cheating? 2:30PM Beginning to get dizzy/spacy, the cigar may be the source. I’ve been using my standing desk and been walking constantly since the morning but now I seem to want prolonged sitting.\n3PM I guess you’d call this lunchtime, same intake as breakfast. It takes the edge off a little. Can’t really sit still anymore, I’m just pacing around but feeling light-headed at the same time.\n6PM Watching movies at the moment which seems to keep the hunger at bay. It’s very much hitting a wall then finding energy from somewhere.\n9PM Bailing an hour early and having a small cup of soup. Put frankly, I felt like I’ve had a temperature for the last few hours and all my body wanted was something wholesome in it, my resistance has totally fallen apart. I felt like I was coming down with an illness and I was worried the lack of food may have brought down my immune system.\nConclusion The illness effect was probably entirely psychosomatic, but I did feel terrible the last few hours, the light spacious feeling I had earlier in the day turned pretty horrible. I’d like to repeat this experiment without the 10km run beforehand and see how it goes. One thing is for sure, I have a completely new respect for anyone who can regularly fast. The ways in which this hit my willpower were completely surprising.\n","wordCount":"539","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2014-02-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-02-06_precision-nutrition-trail-fast-88a4c01976d5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
