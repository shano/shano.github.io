Last night I finished Roddy Doyle&rsquo;s The Woman Who Walked Into Doors and
I figured I&rsquo;d write a quick review on it. It&rsquo;s a book on the life of an
Irish working-class woman named Paula who is struggling with an abusive
husband and attempting to keep her family from the brink that her
husband creates.
The details in this book are what make it particularly excellent
writing. The lead character recalls incredibly specific details that
bring her tragic story to life. There&rsquo;s a few mildly absurd elements to
the book, but they&rsquo;re grounded in the unrelenting reality the lead
character describes. A chipped plate, the heat from a bag of chips on a
cold day, an attempt to describe the burning sensation of being
repeatedly kicked in the back. These elements are what kept me turning
the pages."><meta name=author content="Shane Dowling"><link rel=canonical href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-01-23_review-of-the-woman-who-walked-into-doors-7aec5acb710c/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://shanedowling.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://shanedowling.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-01-23_review-of-the-woman-who-walked-into-doors-7aec5acb710c/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://shanedowling.com/posts/2014-01-23_review-of-the-woman-who-walked-into-doors-7aec5acb710c/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shane Dowling"><meta property="og:title" content="Review of The Woman Who Walked Into Doors"><meta property="og:description" content="
