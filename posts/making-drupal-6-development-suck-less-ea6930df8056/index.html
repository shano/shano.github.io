So you&rsquo;re here. Like myself probably stuck developing for `Drupal
6 `__. All the modules on-line are for
the latest and greatest versions of Drupal and you&rsquo;re scouring posts
from 2009 to try find that deprecated module you really need. Well his
post is dedicated to making your life that little bit less painful,
because I too feel your pain.
Better debugging with devel.
Installation

Install subversion (to allow devel to download the firePHP extension code needed).
Make sure drush is installed.
drush dl devel && drush en devel
Enable user permissions for devel
Enable what you need to at http://rooturl.com/admin/settings/devel
Install FireBug and FirePHP on firefox and enable the Net Panel in firebug

Before I used some shell aliases to alter symlinks to different vim configurations I had. Now, I use vimsauce to manage them. Once you got VimSauce installed(I’d recommend Vundle) create a new Drupal specific sauce with\n:SauceNew drupal\nthen edit it with\n:SauceEdit drupal\nDrupal Vimrc\nThis project provides vimrc customisations for Drupal-specific editing. Exactly what\ndrush @none dl vimrc\nThis should install the file into ~/.drush/vimrc/bundle. Now you need to configure your new vimsauce file to work with the drupal vimrc customisations. The vimrc below should explain things. It’s a merge of the vimsauce default settings, a file I found under ~/.drush/vimrc/examples/vimrc_timplunkett.vim and the pathogen settings.\nset nocompatible call pathogen#infect(’/home/user/.drush/vimrc/bundle’) call pathogen#infect(’/home/user/.vimsauce/drupal/bundle’) \" End of vimrc-install additions.\nlet g:current_dir = “~/code/drupal” exec ‘cd ’ . g:current_dir\n\" Allow Vim-only settings even if they break vi keybindings. set nocompatible\n\" Enable filetype detection filetype plugin on\n\" General settings set incsearch “Find as you type set scrolloff=2 “Number of lines to keep above/below cursor set number “Show line numbers set wildmode=longest,list “Complete longest string, then list alternatives set pastetoggle= “Toggle paste mode set fileformats=unix “Use Unix line endings set history=300 “Number of commands to remember set showmode “Show whether in Visual, Replace, or Insert Mode set showmatch “Show matching brackets/parentheses set backspace=2 “Use standard backspace behavior set hlsearch “Highlight matches in search set ruler “Show line and column number set formatoptions=1 “Don’t wrap text after a one-letter word set linebreak “Break lines when appropriate\n\" Persistent Undo (vim 7.3 and later) if exists(’\u0026undofile’) \u0026\u0026 !\u0026undofile set undodir=~/.vim_runtime/undodir set undofile endif\n\" Enable syntax highlighting if \u0026t_Co \u003e 1 syntax enable endif syntax on\n\" Custom key mapping map :redo map :tabn map :tabp\n\" Uncomment the following to have Vim jump to the last position when \" reopening a file if has(“autocmd”) au BufReadPost * if line(”’””) \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 line(”’””) \u003c= line(\"$”) | exe “normal! g’”” | endif endif\nSticking to a Coding Standard So I try to always adhere to the coding standard of whatever system I’m using. Typically that’s easy but I’ve found getting my hands on a automated check that ensures my code is up to drupal’s standards a little difficult(especially with drupal 6). Firstly you need to install PHP’s codesniffer, which I did using PEAR.\nsudo pear install PHP_CodeSniffer\nIn the end I was forced to use a Drupal 7 specific codesniffer. This project has actually been merged into the Coder project but as I’m using Drupal 6, the current version of coder that works with Drupal 6 doesn’t include the codesniffer. So I nabbed the latest standalone version of drupal codesniffer.\nwget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupalcs-7.x-1.x-dev.tar.gz\nI then extract it to my ~/.drush folder and symlink it to where pear has placed php codesniffers various syntax checking config files\nsudo ln -sv ~/.drush/drupalcs/Drupal $(pear config-getphp_dir)/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards\nNow, this is the setting that I’ve come across that apparently changes phpcs to use Drupal as the standard which codesniffer adheres to.\nUse drupals codesniffer let g:syntastic_phpcs_conf=” — standard=Drupal — extensions=php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme”\nI could not get this to work. It simply refused to budge from the standard PSR syntax checker that is the default for PHP codesniffer. I was forced to just set the default to drupal’s.\nsudo phpcs — config-set default_standard Drupal\nThis is a little annoying if you jump between standard PHP projects and Drupal projects, so I added a system command call to my various vim sauces to set php codesniffer to the correct standard. It should bug you to enter a sudo password, but I’d rather that than having to explicitly run these commands.\ncall system(“sudo phpcs — config-set default_standard Drupal”)\nThis post has already gotten very long but I’ll try to write something up on getting unit-testing up and running with Drupal 6 at a later stage.
