Apparently it can help your marriage.\nI’m not that naive. Frankly, my reasons for swapping away from my smartphone is pretty pragmatic, it was simply a persistent call to mindless action.

I’ve flipped to it when I’m communicating with people, commuting or even watching TV. Apparently TV is no longer enough of a distraction for this half-living brain I seem to have developed.\nSure I could just not use those features, like the Gizmodo article I linked to. I tried this, and cut pretty much everything but the useful stuff out of my phone, it boiled down to maps, public transport apps, RunKeeper and Whatsapp. However, I still constantly found myself in a tug of war where I would uninstall, then re-install browsers for an information fix. Just because it was easy and I could. It got to the point where I discovered a really small(100KB or so) browser so I could get my internet fix even faster. I realised my phone wasn’t giving me enough benefit for the mental costs. Maybe I’m particularly weak, I’m sure others can happily keep their smart-phones at a healthy distance, but I accepted that I simply couldn’t.\nHow? As soon as I realised I hadn’t the ability to distance myself from my phone and that this was negatively effecting my mindfulness, I needed to figure out a way solve this. What I wanted to do was maintain some of the useful benefits of a smart-phone minus the distractions. Taking a cold hard look at the realistic benefits I got from my phone really helped.\nThe features I wanted(not needed) started with GPS-based maps of some sort. London is big, without GPS maps I knew I’d spend a lot of time getting lost, which isn’t so bad sometimes but maps are essential when I need to be at a place at a certain time, which happens quite often. I also use RunKeeper a lot and enjoyed looking at my stats and progress, it wasn’t a deal-breaker but I worried about my motivation to run. The same with can be said for using Sleep as Android which I used for logging sleep patterns. I like being able to view how many hours I’m sleeping each night, it’s a very useful to me and has generally improved my wellbeing. Finally, as I’m a contractor, I spend a lot of time taking photos of receipts for expenses etc, I’ve found Evernote really useful for this. Eventually, I decided to get myself a Symbian, so a half smart/dumb-phone. Specifically the Nokia 6730. Essentially because it supports 3G and GPS. Symbian also supported Whatsapp, Viber, Endomondo(no RunKeeper unfortunately) and even Evernote. I also picked up a FitBit One, for exercise and sleep logging.\nResults Advantages I don’t browse anymore, ever. Frankly, browsing the web is so painful to do on this phone I’ve tried once, got nowhere and never again. The OVI store is terrible. It doesn’t even save my username and password, and typing those in on this device is enough of a reason never to install another app. Google Maps/GPS has been better than I expected. Basically, there’s a little more typing but the GPS/maps combo has been spot on for me. Endomondo has been terrific. Granted you can’t multi-task with it, so if you get lost you need to stop your run, check your map and start another run. I still thing it’s great. I even contributed some code to an app that allows you to convert your RunKeeper data to Endomondo. You can grab it here. I also discovered SoundHound is on here, a nice to have little discovery. My phone is no longer a thing. It’s a boring piece of tech in the background. When I need to get in touch with someone, odds are I’ll just call them. No twitter, email or facebook. It is just a phone with a few bells and whistles. The Fitbit sleep logging shows a little timer of how long I’ve slept, I found this quite useful if I’ve woken up too early. Disadvantages The Fitbit hasn’t been very useful. I could’ve survived without the sleep logging and it doesn’t really capture runs properly. It’s trying more to be an overall health system and one that requires a smartphone so you can input a ton of data into. How much water you drink, what calories your taking in etc etc. I didn’t need any of this. In hindsight I wouldn’t have bothered with it. The Evernote client also didn’t support my phone. This is quite annoying, it means I can’t in the moment grab useful data or take quick snapshots and have them backed up. But the phone’s camera is decent enough, so I’m hoping I’ll work out a different alternative. Viber didn’t actually support my phone, not a big deal. That’s about it really. I’ve been using my dumb-phone for the last few weeks, and I haven’t really missed my Samsung SIII, other than Evernote really. Honestly, considering how distracted I was with the phone I thought it would be a much more difficult transition. I guess because I’d reduced my smart-phone down to the bare essentials as it was, I wasn’t losing a tremendous amount of features. It genuinely looks like the future of my phone tech is going to be a crappy 4 year old phone running an even crappier 13 year old operating system. February 28, 2014 – Counterfeit Update - I’m still using my dumb-phone and loving it. In fact, one Saturday I trialled using my Samsung S3 for a day and couldn’t stand it, I constantly kept checking it and that drove my crazy. Giving it away as a gift.\n","wordCount":"1019","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2014-01-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2014-01-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shane Dowling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://shanedowling.com/posts/switching-to-a-dumbphone-3b090f8ad709/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Shane Dowling","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://shanedowling.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://shanedowling.com/ accesskey=h title="Shane Dowling (Alt + H)">Shane Dowling</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
