      <title>Beware the todo list</title>

&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working off a varying series of to-do lists to drive my life. I use a mix of the Things app, my bullet journal, and a calendar. Basically, my setup is to have annual Smart Goals, broken down into achievable chunks, then broken down into tasks to knock off todo lists. On the face of it, it&amp;rsquo;s a way to organise a wiggly world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is part 3 in a series on lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from several years of freelancing. You can find Part 1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://shanedowling.com/developer-lessons-from-2017-part-1-14c31f45307c&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Part 2 &lt;a href=&#34;https://shanedowling.com/freelancer-lessons-part-2-e5700002d8b&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though you can read these in no specific order really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;watch-your-mental-state&#34;&gt;Watch your mental state&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re working a full-time job, you&amp;rsquo;ll have people around you who will get to know you over time. Professional relationships start to develop, people will start to recognise you &amp;lsquo;on a good day&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;on a bad day&amp;rsquo; with enough &amp;lsquo;bad days&amp;rsquo; on the trot almost always a caring co-worker or a good boss will check in on you, perhaps help with your workload or just lend an ear to listen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a series of posts on lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while freelancing for the past four years. You can find Part 1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://shanedowling.com/developer-lessons-from-2017-part-1-14c31f45307c?source=linkShare-c3fb4f3f97d3-1514928400&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;focusing-on-profits-only&#34;&gt;Focusing on &amp;ldquo;profits only&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve alluded to this in my previous post, but, now that you&amp;rsquo;re a business, you may start to make decisions that optimise being a business, not a person. It becomes easier to start making decisions that might lead to say personal burnout for the sake of professional business health. Taking holidays was a big one for me, while contracting I never once took as many holidays as my partners mandatory holidays in her full time roles. Knowing your invoices were about to take a big hit next month by taking say, two weeks off will always be hanging over your head. Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve calculated that you would get paid a whole lot more over an annual period if you took a bunch of holidays while contacting when decision time comes for that month, it can be tough to make the call to take that time off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Looking back on this year, many of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned had less to do with specific technologies and more to do with long term career growth. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a developer now for 9 years and as a result, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think more about longer term goals and happiness. As a result I made the decision to move from contracting back to full time work towards the tail end of the year so a lot of my reflections are tied around the costs of short term thinking and contracting in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve written on another site how I use Rescuetime to provide metrics on my overall productivity that I can review each week. One useful feature I noticed was Rescuetime highlights, which gives you a good overview of your accompishments throughout the day. The first thing I wanted to add to this (obviously) was git commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily it turns out someone had already thought of this and implemented
it. The script itself is here, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to reproduce it below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying different ways to increase my
productivity, specifically during work hours. From todo lists to
pomodoro&amp;rsquo;s, xeffect cards, the autofocus method and even back to GTD.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a pattern with a lot of these techniques. They all require
a pile of maintenance and none of them actually give you much in terms
of positive feedback. When you mark a task off a list, you&amp;rsquo;re often not
getting the satisfaction of completion because that task is in the
middle of a huge pile of other tasks you have yet to face. These lists
goal to complete, all lists and systems have done is given me two
problems to solve. The Pomodoro technique especially, the amount of
over-head and tracking you need to do just to discover productivity
trends is painful. How off were your estimates, how many interruptions
did you log last Tuesday, it&amp;rsquo;s all a bit messy and overwhelming after a
while, and difficult to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago(to the day) I wrote a post on why I was &lt;a href=&#34;http://shanedowling.com/giving-up-on-wikis/&#34;&gt;Giving up on wikis&lt;/a&gt; and I have to admit, four years later my opinions on the topic really haven&amp;rsquo;t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been 4 years, 700 questions(with 800 answers) and several server
moves later and by and large the process hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed all that much,
everything is just little more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lance Armstrong has shown the world, putting the right thing into
your body can greatly improve performance, I myself have been looking
into more maintainable alternative. More and more I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with
diet as a means to improve my mental performance as well as my running
ability week on week. Specifically ways of optimising the meals I&amp;rsquo;m
taking in and turning them into more efficient forms of food
consumption. Looking into my diet was partially kicked off by my recent
foray into fasting and also looking at the spectacular popularity of the
soylent project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I read a post on Sebastian Marshall&amp;rsquo;s blog about &lt;a href=&#34;http://sebastianmarshall.com/a-method-for-reliability-quitting-caffeine&#34;&gt;cutting caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, in which goes into the benefits and a method he uses for quitting coffee. He suggests cycling off it to reset your tolerance every so often. I figured that was a really good idea since I&amp;rsquo;d gotten to the
point where in the morning I needed a coffee to feel normal, it was a
good time to do something about it. Sebastian&amp;rsquo;s method of taking caffeine pills I found a little extreme. There&amp;rsquo;s a certain aesthetic to drinking coffee that I really enjoy and trying to replace it with green tea and pills wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work. Sebastian may have a mental strength I simply don&amp;rsquo;t possess so I needed to offset the caffeine with altering the experience much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sleep as the fundamental habit</title>

&lt;p&gt;Leo Babuta describes meditation as the fundamental habit, the underlying habits beneath all others. Personally, I disagree. I wrote recently on how I cope with meditation when you haven&amp;rsquo;t had a particularly good nights sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically washing your face is like taking painkillers after a
serious injury, it&amp;rsquo;s only painting over the cracks of a deeper problem.
Meditation and mindfulness truly can unlock the potential of your day,
but a good nights rests can even more. Sleep is a physical process that
underlies every waking moment. So to actively take the time to develop
good sleep habits should improve every other aspect in your life,
including meditation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/generation-y-unhappy_b_3930620.html&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; was shared with me recently, it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent read and provides some good reasoning for why people feel that vague sense of living an unaccomplished life. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it, I am most definitely a Gypsy. My garden right now it full of flowers of unrealistic expectations. I&amp;rsquo;d begun to discover this while meditating and watching my emotions daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://shanedowling.com/images/1__dgV1eOnLLrwiaafzuZ__klg__2x.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.headspace.com/&#34;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; there&amp;rsquo;s a section called the discovery series. You begin to focus on watching your emotions throughout the day and when your mind gets distracted and wanders. More specifically you watch the ways in which you wish things were different. You begin to notice the gulf between reality and fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Performance gains by altering your routine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the mornings I had a very structured routine. The first thing I would
do is meditate as for me, all other habits flow from this. Then after my
meditation I would either go for a run or do some dumbbell based
strength exercises. The reasoning being that as exercising was also a
quiet periods, I could try extending the mindfulness and clarity gained
from meditation into my exercises and have a better chance of remaining mindful throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://xmonad.org/&#34;&gt;Xmonad&lt;/a&gt; - Xmonad is a Haskell based window
manager for both Linux and Mac(sorry Windows users). It&amp;rsquo;s highly
configurable but for me it&amp;rsquo;s lack of features and application bar crap
is a real advantage. The application your currently working with takes
up the entirety of the screen and you navigate to other applications
using keyboard shortcuts. Using this and disabling notifications in your
IM/Email/whatever clients forces you to work on the task in front of
you. It&amp;rsquo;s very pleasing to use after a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GSD 3 — Keeping your habits in mind</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve removed your distractions and figured out how to maintain
focus. You&amp;rsquo;ve a set of good habits you&amp;rsquo;d like to being implementing.
Well firstly, read &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenhabits.net/sticky/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Don&amp;rsquo;t jump head first into habits you&amp;rsquo;ve never gone through before. You&amp;rsquo;re expectations will be too high and sadly, you&amp;rsquo;ll likely fail. Patience is a virtue.
So, after you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen the habit you&amp;rsquo;d like to begin with, here are
some tools to help keep you focused on those good habits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the final process I use to help me get shit done is reviewing. Each
week I do a fairly lengthy review of the last week. I see what habits
have been successful and which have been a struggle to maintain. I look
to see if there are appropriate alterations I can use to help improve.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the things I tend to analyse while reviewing, and the
questions I&amp;rsquo;ve asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GSD 1 — Reducing Distractions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my distractions currently come from within. I hit up social
media or news sites. Also my email is a big time waster. I needed a way
to remain connected but while preventing regular access. Here&amp;rsquo;s what
helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/viccherubini/get-shit-done&#34;&gt;Get Shit Done&lt;/a&gt;-A cross platform OS level site blocker. Simply install the script, add your distracting sites and run &amp;lsquo;get-shit-done work&amp;rsquo; in a terminal. You only notice sheer number of times you find yourself flicking to those distracting sites when a big error is thrown that the site is unavailable. It&amp;rsquo;s a learning experience. Your browser however, may cache URL lookups and you may still access distracting sites when I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t and visa-versa. On Firefox there is an extension called &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dns-cache/&#34;&gt;DNS
Cache&lt;/a&gt;. It allows you to prevent Firefox caching DNS entries, I presume this slows down URL requests but I barely noticed a difference and GSD now works as it should.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I created a number of long term goals recently and have been trying to
work out a system within which I can continue to keep my focus on those long term goals and reduce procrastination. I try to promote a daily focus on long term tasks through reminders and regular reviews while reducing procrastination through a set of core tools. I tried multiple tools/tricks and what I&amp;rsquo;ll post a series on the tools and tricks I used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Productivity has never been my strong point. I&amp;rsquo;m the ultimate
procrastinator. I will literally do anything other than the task at
hand. In fact this post is likely being written purely as I don&amp;rsquo;t want
to study. But, the post itself is useful in it&amp;rsquo;s function to push me
forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten attracted to a very simple idea of &amp;ldquo;Just keep going&amp;rdquo;. In my
head I imagine the Terminator, after being blown to bits, still getting
up. I suffer from &amp;ldquo;Goldilocks procrastination&amp;rdquo;, essentially everything
needs to be just right before anything can happen. On top of that
everything needs to remain perfect for me to maintain it. On paper it&amp;rsquo;s
insanely obvious that this will fail, but a lesson that&amp;rsquo;s taken me a
while to learn. If I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the study materials or if I miss a
run during the week and boom, never again. What&amp;rsquo;s the point?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;evernote&#34;&gt;Evernote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I use evernote as my brain online for everthing, it is
incredibly useful for programmers too. Where I work things like
requirements can be captured on almost anything, so snapping photos of
whiteboards/notepads/beer mats that become OCR searchable is very handy.
On top of that it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have all notes auto stored up on the web(I&amp;rsquo;d
have a fit if I lost my developer diary over a hard drive crash). The
client application for evernote could be better and I&amp;rsquo;d consider
Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s OneNote a much better application but Evernote does
everything I need it too. The killer feature being the iPhone app that
lets me capture text, voice and snapshots everywhere. Coupled with JotNot it gives me a very powerful information capturing device that I simply cannot live without. This is one of the truly killer apps for my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
