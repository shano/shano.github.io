&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/2-billion-startup-github-could-be-for-sale-microsoft-2018-5&#34;&gt;Microsoft has been in talks with Github&lt;/a&gt; about a potential acquisition. There are several reasons why this is a terrible idea. Github is a pretty solid git repo hosting company, but it has a few core values that are in jeopardy here and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure Microsoft(or anyone) can acquire an entity like Github without severe repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;platform-agnostic-integrations&#34;&gt;Platform agnostic integrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github has a ton of super useful integrations that help make the life for developers a lot easier. Tools like appveyor, travis-ci, coverall, readthedocs, codacy are really useful and what&amp;rsquo;s so great is you free to run them wherever you like. How can Microsoft make the business case to keep platform agnostic integrations that are aiding competitors? Maybe they won&amp;rsquo;t ban them, but they may become very much second class citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wild Wild Country – The Soundtrack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://shanedowling.com/images/1____IGWS6a7nQTfKgT6H5FQZw__2x.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen Netflix&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netflix.com/title/80145240?s=i&amp;amp;trkid=14170286&#34;&gt;Wild Wild Country&lt;/a&gt;, I highly recommend you watch it. The story told, along with the wealth of footage they got their hands on makes it an incredible watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is also excellent, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together the soundtrack as a playlist on Apple Music, you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/playlist/wild-wild-country-soundtrack/pl.u-4Jomzk2tMMl6Gm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Short Review of &#39;Freedom from the Known&#39;</title>

&lt;p&gt;Freedom from the Known can be a tough book to crack, the lessons offered within are almost dismissed by the arguments made within the book, on top of that it&amp;rsquo;s likely most won&amp;rsquo;t be in a position to even accept what they read as they are reading it. Despite these barriers, there is still wonderful lessons here calling out our own values, our judgements and what is preventing us from being truly free and present in each moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Friday Fun — Offline 8tracks playlists using Grooveshark</title>
      <link>https://shanedowling.com/posts/friday-fun-offline-8tracks-playlists-using-grooveshark-34b2512270df/</link>

      <guid>https://shanedowling.com/posts/friday-fun-offline-8tracks-playlists-using-grooveshark-34b2512270df/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking about how they might offline their
favourite 8track tracks and I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a rudimentary solution
while I was doing some offline coding. On 8tracks I&amp;rsquo;ve found a great
playlist series called Cold Machines created by user sowat on 8tracks and I wanted to offline my favourited tracks from these playlists as they&amp;rsquo;re great for
coding to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there&amp;rsquo;s no direct way to do this it&amp;rsquo;s a several step process, but an
pretty easy one at that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Counterfeited Blog Post</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_the_Novel&#34;&gt;E. M. Forster&amp;rsquo;s Aspects of the Novel&lt;/a&gt; and in it I came across a discussion on the French writer André Gide, specifically about his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Counterfeiters_%28novel%29&#34;&gt;Les faux-monnayeurs(The Counterfeiters)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a merge of reality and fiction, Gide himself keeps a journal
of his life as he writes the book and appears to merge the two. The
writer is celebrated in Aspects for hurling himself into the novel and
for not being bound by the style at the time or &amp;ldquo;All that is
prearranged&amp;rdquo;.
There&amp;rsquo;s a good example of it in this passage. When brought into a
discussion about the book Edouard(who is Gide&amp;rsquo;s representation in the
book) responds on it&amp;rsquo;s subject. I suggest you read this passage but keep
blogging in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Precision Nutrition Trail Fast</title>
      <link>https://shanedowling.com/posts/archived/precision-nutrition-trail-fast-88a4c01976d5/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.precisionnutrition.com/intermittent-fasting/chapter-1&#34;&gt;precision nutrition trial fast last&lt;/a&gt; Sunday, here&amp;rsquo;s a low-down on how things went through each of the steps. I had trialled this while out and about in central London, but failed at around 5pm, I was disorganised and feeling incredibly dizzy from the crowds and noise, so this time I planned ahead and did this from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-pm-saturday&#34;&gt;10 PM Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a late dinner at the wonderful Chaat on RedChurch Street in Shoreditch. May as well have an epic last meal, right? The advantage of the late final meal was that I actually managed to ramble in from the street and only waited a minute for a table. I didn&amp;rsquo;t over-do it in terms of food. I often get hungrier the next morning if I eat a huge meal the night before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review of The Woman Who Walked Into Doors</title>

&lt;p&gt;Last night I finished Roddy Doyle&amp;rsquo;s The Woman Who Walked Into Doors and
I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write a quick review on it. It&amp;rsquo;s a book on the life of an
Irish working-class woman named Paula who is struggling with an abusive
husband and attempting to keep her family from the brink that her
husband creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details in this book are what make it particularly excellent
writing. The lead character recalls incredibly specific details that
bring her tragic story to life. There&amp;rsquo;s a few mildly absurd elements to
the book, but they&amp;rsquo;re grounded in the unrelenting reality the lead
character describes. A chipped plate, the heat from a bag of chips on a
cold day, an attempt to describe the burning sensation of being
repeatedly kicked in the back. These elements are what kept me turning
the pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Legitimate ways to support good movies</title>

&lt;p&gt;Recently I watched Akira Kurosawa&amp;rsquo;s Ikiru, after reading
through some of the Criterion info on Kurosawa I realised I&amp;rsquo;d watched a
bunch of his movies, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Seven Samurai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Criterion Collection is a wonderful distribution company and I&amp;rsquo;m a
huge fan of a number of their filmmakers, so much so that I wanted to
try and support the service more. Since I live fairly lightly in terms
of possessions I can&amp;rsquo;t really justify $40 on a DVD or Blu-Ray.
Especially since I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have moved elsewhere and be forced to
ditch the media before I can watch it a second time.
It&amp;rsquo;s a shame when distribution companies haven&amp;rsquo;t really adopted digital
distribution. I am aware that Criterion is on Hulu(now something else), but unfortunately as I&amp;rsquo;m not a US resident I can&amp;rsquo;t access/support it. If you are and can access it, I highly recommend checking out some of their movies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one
instead.&amp;rdquo; — Mark Twain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with consistently writing. I find it
difficult to sit down in the morning and begin to write. Usually ideas
fall out of my head and I get into a flow quite quickly but recently,
without a clear idea sitting in my head for a period of time I simply
can&amp;rsquo;t put pen to paper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>South Africa</title>
      <link>https://shanedowling.com/posts/archived/south-africa-c688b9070707/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d been in Cape Town for two weeks beforehand, just remotely working
and doing some sightseeing around the area. So I had plenty of time for
prep for the trip and was pretty relaxed arriving at Ashanti Logde(where
the trip starts). The trip was booked through African Budget
Safari&amp;rsquo;s which seemed to the cheapest option around. The dates I had originally planned to travel with(and booked) were unavailable and ABS happily changed my dates and gave me a heavy discount(about 25%). On top of that I declined the free activities in Cape Town, so I was given free upgrade at Ashanti to my own room. So I can definitely recommend African Budget Safari&amp;rsquo;s as an agent and also chance your arm and see what discounts you can get.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Overlanding</title>
      <link>https://shanedowling.com/posts/archived/overlanding-ac775c297d46/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://shanedowling.com/posts/archived/overlanding-ac775c297d46/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, for the last 6 weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been over-landing from Cape Town to
Nairobi. I decided to ditch almost all of my tech for the trip. My
Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Thinkpad were replaced with an old school phone
and a notepad. I also picked up a tiny little Sandisk Sansa Clip MP3
player for the trip. For reading I had my Kindle and a few USB keys for
storing files and for Portableapps(which was a disaster I&amp;rsquo;ll write about
another time). The decision for ditching was simply a need to be away
from the tech and connectedness. I&amp;rsquo;m in Africa for a reason, and I
simply didn&amp;rsquo;t want the constant distractions a phone brings me. I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice on the way others were clamouring for internet
when they thought it was an option. I appreciated having that option.
Anyway, as a result I have a lot of time to write with the long journeys
during the day and frankly I wish I had more information on the trip to
see where the land lies before starting, so I figured I write this blog
to give others a heads up and I&amp;rsquo;ve split things up into each
destination.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the skinny on countries I hit&lt;/p&gt;</description>
