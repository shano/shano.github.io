      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve relatively recently moved into a Platform Engineering position after working in very developer oriented teams for many years. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that the engineers you work with have much more diverse and interesting backgrounds in terms of their experience, so there&amp;rsquo;s a real opportunity to grow and learn a lot more, as opposed to a more homogenous set of developers. With that in mind, I wanted to put together materials on how a more ops focused engineer can up-skill in Python(as that&amp;rsquo;s more my wheel-house), in particular what are the things that would help you move into a more Python-focused role.</description>
