      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see the media dog-piling on Facebook so much lately. None of this &amp;rsquo;news&amp;rsquo; seems to actually be conveying much that&amp;rsquo;s new, more that it&amp;rsquo;s started taking what was slowly becoming normalised and framed it in a way to highlight the outrage. I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly like the media&amp;rsquo;s approach but I can&amp;rsquo;t feel too sorry about Facebook. We should be outraged with their on-going behaviour.&#xA;Four years ago I wrote an article about de-activating Facebook, I have not used Facebook since then and I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve permanently deleted my account somewhere along the way.</description>

      <description>While I was camping along the West Coast of the US, I heard about the Leave No Trace movement and found the idea very much resonated with me. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself looking around day to day and wondering where I could start leaving less of a trace. We can all hate on consumerism, but lets face it, well all need to consume a certain amount to live in the modern world.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meditating now for 150 days straight, but even before that I was a fairly regular meditator for many years, I had just never kept up with any sort of meaningful streak every single day. My current momentum started from a difficult period in my life and even once that difficulty subsided, there was still a desire to keep going with the streak. 150 days later and I&amp;rsquo;m still happy to maintain it, but figured I&amp;rsquo;d write down a few insights I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten from this whole period.</description>

      <title>Promoting mindfulness through the day</title>

      <description>Over the last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been cultivating a mindfulness habit. Overall, it has delivered great results. One of the aspects I&amp;rsquo;ve been less than happy with however, is my ability to carry that mindful state with me throughout the day. I&amp;rsquo;m unsure if it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer and my mind has to be so wrapped up in what I&amp;rsquo;m doing that mindfulness will inevitably get pushed out or if it&amp;rsquo;s simply that full-day mindfulness isn&amp;rsquo;t possible for me.</description>

      <title>Tired meditation</title>

      <description>When I imagine myself doing meditation, I see myself almost leaping out of bed with boundless energy, followed by a full and focused period of breathing exercises. Nothing could be further from the truth. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m working through the Discovery Series on Headspace and it&amp;rsquo;s focusing more on looking at your body and how it feels. Now, a lot of what the meditation suggests is, is to use focus to alleviate the negative feelings that occur in your body.</description>
