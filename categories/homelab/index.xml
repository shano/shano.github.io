      <description>So, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while and I have made some progress worth sharing!&#xA;After keeping an eye on the auction sites for a while I ended up pulling the plug and buying 2 12TB Seagate Ironwolf drives for my NAS and now wanted to get started with setting this up.&#xA;The hardware Off a recommendation from Joe at Late Night Linux I picked up a HP 290 G2 I5-8500. It comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256ssd.</description>

      <title>Homelab - Day 4 - Self-Hosting Gitea</title>

      <description>Aims Today’s goal was to deploy Gitea on my K3s cluster, ensuring that:&#xA;It used persistent storage via my NAS. It was accessible externally through Traefik. It could eventually replace GitHub for my FluxCD setup. What I Did Storage and Permissions Woes Running Gitea as a stateless container worked fine initially, but as soon as I introduced persistence, things got tricky. I ran into permission issues almost immediately, thanks to the interplay between Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; user permissions and my NAS file system.</description>

      <title>Homelab - Day 3 - The first software deployment</title>

      <description>Aims The goal for today was to get my first piece of software running on the cluster, ensuring that:&#xA;It leveraged the NAS for storage. It was accessible externally via Traefik. The process was repeatable for future deployments. I chose the Unifi Management Console as my first self-hosted application. Once migrated, I could wipe my Raspberry Pi 4, which was previously running the console, and add it as a worker node to the cluster.</description>

      <description>After going back and forth multiple times and making plenty of mistakes, I finally managed to set up a new K3s control plane and node. It turned out to be relatively straightforward once I got the steps right, so I’m documenting this for future reference!&#xA;Aims The goal was to set up a fresh K3s cluster, ensuring that:&#xA;The control plane and node are configured correctly. Flux is properly bootstrapped to manage cluster state.</description>

      <title>Homelab - Day 1 - Really Ghetto Data Storage</title>

      <description>Setting Up Storage for the Kubernetes Cluster The first step in setting up my homelab Kubernetes cluster is ensuring some reliable data storage. Right now, I have two main categories of data in mind:&#xA;1. Operationally Critical Data Needs RAID with redundancy Requires both on-site and off-site backups Approximately 1TB of data 2. Media Data Non-critical, so no backups required Several terabytes of storage needed Since the Kubernetes cluster depends on Operationally Critical Data, I need to establish a RAID-backed storage solution with proper backups before moving forward.</description>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m Migrating My Self-Hosted Services I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to migrate all my existing self-hosted services—and add a few new ones—to a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster that I&amp;rsquo;m going to build. There are several motivations behind this decision:&#xA;Learning Kubernetes Beyond Ephemeral Clusters My role as an Engineering Manager at Syntasso involves a lot of K8s development using Kind, but these environments are entirely ephemeral. I want to experience the long-term challenges of operating a cluster to build greater empathy for our customers.</description>
