    <p>After reading up on <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</a>
I decided I would implement a habit called Morning Pages. Effectively
you commit to writing several pages of writing each and every morning,
for me I intended to write a blog post unit each day, and decide which
ones were worthy enough of sharing towards the end of the week. I was
building up a healthy morning routine and figured one more habit
wouldn't be too much to ask of myself.</p>
<p>I failed. Repeatedly. Two months in and I'd managed about five totally
random mornings of writing. All of them on weekends. It kept feeling
non-essential compared to my other habits and I felt like the pressure
of getting to work at a reasonable hour build up as I sat down to try
and write. I simply couldn't commit and I couldn't focus on writing.
So, in this sorry state I figured out a great way to introduce new
habits that actually immediately worked for me. <strong>All new habits are
done first.</strong> Simple as that, whenever you have a routine or when you're about to knuckle down and be productive always start with your newest
habit. It's the one you have the most tenuous hold on and should be
prioritised accordingly until it can become an establish part of your
routine. I've been writing every morning for about a month and a half
now and I've only missed one day(due to extreme tiredness). Also because it's the first thing I do when I wake, I've started to incorporate
dreams into creative writing, it's been very rewarding actually. I think
this habit is here to stay.</p>
