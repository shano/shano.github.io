    <p>So, for the last 6 weeks I've been over-landing from Cape Town to
Nairobi. I decided to ditch almost all of my tech for the trip. My
Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Thinkpad were replaced with an old school phone
and a notepad. I also picked up a tiny little Sandisk Sansa Clip MP3
player for the trip. For reading I had my Kindle and a few USB keys for
storing files and for Portableapps(which was a disaster I'll write about
another time). The decision for ditching was simply a need to be away
from the tech and connectedness. I'm in Africa for a reason, and I
simply didn't want the constant distractions a phone brings me. I
couldn't help but notice on the way others were clamouring for internet
when they thought it was an option. I appreciated having that option.
Anyway, as a result I have a lot of time to write with the long journeys
during the day and frankly I wish I had more information on the trip to
see where the land lies before starting, so I figured I write this blog
to give others a heads up and I've split things up into each
destination.
Here's the skinny on countries I hit</p>
<ul>
<li>South Africa</li>
<li>Namibia</li>
<li>Bostswana</li>
<li>Zimbabwe</li>
<li>Zambia</li>
<li>Malawi</li>
<li>Tanzania(and Zanzibar)</li>
<li>Kenya</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll fill these in as links when the posts are written.</p>
