    <p>After reading through Code Complete I decided to make up mind-maps on
each topic in the hope that I would peruse them every so often to brush
up on my programming best practice. Recently I decided take a look over
them and was dismayed at the amount of knowledge from the book I'd
forgotten or that hadn't become habit. Sure I'd remember a decent chunk
of the good stuff and it has certainly improved my programming ability
but there was so much I'd missed, even from the tiny mind-maps I'd made.</p>
<p>I was trying to figure out a way to embed some of the 'good practices'
into my programming, in a way to force myself to review them in the hope
they would become habit. Luckily I'd recently come across the awesome <a href="https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate">snipMate</a> plug-in for vim so I decided to include a number of good programming practices into the snippets themselves and while I could only really get in a tiny percentage of it I feel these tips will enhance my ability at
the lowest level of programming.</p>
<p>It will probably really grate having to delete all of these dumped
comments from my snippets, but I figure by having the text front of me
every-time I create a new if statement or a new function I expect my
coding standards to increase significantly. I will also start creating
snippets that represent explanations of certain programming concepts,
with actual pseudo-code.</p>
<p>Anyway, feel free to check-out the PHP snippet file <a href="https://github.com/shano/Vim-SnipMate-Coding-Standards">here</a>, will add to it as I find missing things/enhancements</p>
