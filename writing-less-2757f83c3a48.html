<p>"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one
instead." â€” Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lately I've been struggling with consistently writing. I find it
difficult to sit down in the morning and begin to write. Usually ideas
fall out of my head and I get into a flow quite quickly but recently,
without a clear idea sitting in my head for a period of time I simply
can't put pen to paper.</p>
<p>I also just finished reading Charlie Brooker's article on "`Reducing
my word emissions" and I must admit some of his points are pretty convincing. There is a lot of noise on the internet and I suspect a lot of my unwillingness to return to writing is due to this.
I'm also working on a project similar to stackoverflow and I'm truly beginning to appreciate the format of the site. The internet simply has too much noise to signal.</p>
<p>I'm going to try keep a hard limit on my posts of 200 words and see
if the limit can't help the writers block.</p>
