        <h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I am aware, that while there is a trend towards smart-phones there are
quite a few articles around on the subject of people swapping back to a
dumb-phone or even <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5991495/why-my-iphone-is-better-as-a-dumbphone">using your smartphone as a dumphone</a>. Apparently it can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/10/31/why-i-dumped-my-smartphone-for-a-7-year-old-motorola-razr/">help your marriage</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not that naive. Frankly, my reasons for swapping away from my
smartphone is pretty pragmatic, it was simply a persistent call to
mindless action. That I carried around in my pocket. Everywhere.
I found myself in a constant state of half-living, meaning half of my
mind is on the present moment and the other half on a device. I've
flipped to it when I'm communicating with people, commuting or even
watching TV. Apparently TV is no longer enough of a distraction for this
half-living brain I seem to have developed.</p>
<p>Sure I could just not use those features, like the Gizmodo article I
linked to. I tried this, and cut pretty much everything but the useful
stuff out of my phone, it boiled down to maps, public transport apps,
RunKeeper and Whatsapp. However, I still constantly found myself in a
tug of war where I would uninstall, then re-install browsers for an
information fix. Just because it was easy and I could. It got to the
point where I discovered a really small(100KB or so) browser so I could
get my internet fix even faster. I realised my phone wasn't giving me
enough benefit for the mental costs. Maybe I'm particularly weak, I'm
sure others can happily keep their smart-phones at a healthy distance,
but I accepted that I simply couldn't.</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>As soon as I realised I hadn't the ability to distance myself from my
phone and that this was negatively effecting my mindfulness, I needed to figure out a way solve this. What I wanted to do was maintain some of the useful benefits of a smart-phone minus the distractions. Taking a
cold hard look at the realistic benefits I got from my phone really helped.</p>
<p>The features I wanted(not needed) started with GPS-based maps of some sort. London is big, without GPS maps I knew I'd spend a lot of time getting lost, which isn't so bad sometimes but maps are essential when I need to be at a place at a certain time, which happens quite often. I also use RunKeeper a lot and enjoyed looking at my stats and progress, it wasn't a deal-breaker but I worried about my motivation to run. The same with can be said for using Sleep as Android which I used for logging sleep patterns. I like being able to view how many hours I'm sleeping each night, it's a very useful to me and has generally improved my wellbeing. Finally, as I'm a contractor, I spend a lot of time taking photos of receipts for expenses etc, I've found Evernote really useful for this.
Eventually, I decided to get myself a Symbian, so a half
smart/dumb-phone. Specifically the Nokia 6730.
Essentially because it supports 3G and GPS. Symbian also supported Whatsapp, Viber, Endomondo(no RunKeeper unfortunately) and even Evernote. I also picked up a FitBit One, for exercise and sleep logging.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>I don't browse anymore, ever. Frankly, browsing the web is so painful to do on this phone I've tried once, got nowhere and never again.</li>
<li>The OVI store is terrible. It doesn't even save my username and password, and typing those in on this device is enough of a reason never to install another app.</li>
<li>Google Maps/GPS has been better than I expected. Basically, there's a little more typing but the GPS/maps combo has been spot on for me.</li>
<li>Endomondo has been terrific. Granted you can't multi-task with it, so if you get lost you need to stop your run, check your map and start another run. I still thing it's great. I even contributed some code to an app that allows you to convert your RunKeeper data to Endomondo. You can grab it <a href="https://github.com/shano/runkeeper2endomondo">here</a>.</li>
<li>I also discovered SoundHound is on here, a nice to have little discovery.</li>
<li>My phone is no longer a thing. It's a boring piece of tech in the background. When I need to get in touch with someone, odds are I'll just call them. No twitter, email or facebook. It is just a phone with a few bells and whistles.</li>
<li>The Fitbit sleep logging shows a little timer of how long I've slept, I found this quite useful if I've woken up too early.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Fitbit hasn't been very useful. I could've survived without the sleep logging and it doesn't really capture runs properly. It's trying more to be an overall health system and one that requires a smartphone so you can input a ton of data into. How much water you drink, what calories your taking in etc etc. I didn't need any of this. In hindsight I wouldn't have bothered with it.</li>
<li>The Evernote client also didn't support my phone. This is quite annoying, it means I can't in the moment grab useful data or take quick snapshots and have them backed up. But the phone's camera is decent enough, so I'm hoping I'll work out a different alternative.</li>
<li>Viber didn't actually support my phone, not a big deal.
That's about it really. I've been using my dumb-phone for the last few
weeks, and I haven't really missed my Samsung SIII, other than Evernote
really. Honestly, considering how distracted I was with the phone I
thought it would be a much more difficult transition. I guess because
I'd reduced my smart-phone down to the bare essentials as it was, I
wasn't losing a tremendous amount of features.
It genuinely looks like the future of my phone tech is going to be a
crappy 4 year old phone running an even crappier 13 year old operating
system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>February 28, 2014 â€“</strong> Counterfeit Update - I'm still
using my dumb-phone and loving it. In fact, one Saturday I trialled
using my Samsung S3 for a day and couldn't stand it, I constantly kept
checking it and that drove my crazy. Giving it away as a gift.</p>
