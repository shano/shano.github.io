    <p>A lot of people have been asking about how they might offline their
favourite 8track tracks and I've come up with a rudimentary solution
while I was doing some offline coding. On 8tracks I've found a great
playlist series called Cold Machines created by user sowat on 8tracks and I wanted to offline my favourited tracks from these playlists as they're great for
coding to.</p>
<p>As there's no direct way to do this it's a several step process, but an
pretty easy one at that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="http://8trackshelper.appspot.com/">8trackshelper</a> to generate a plain-text copy of your favourite tracks, simply paste in your username.</li>
<li>Then paste the plaintext list into <a href="http://groovylists.com/?do=plaintext">groovylist's plaintext importer</a>.</li>
<li>This will create a temporary playlist which you can add to an existing playlist or create a new one</li>
<li>Finally, download <a href="http://groovesquid.com/">groovesquid</a> and have it offline your newly created playlist.(Note: I could not get the Mac variant to run as it was damaged, I simply downloaded the jar file and ran 'java -jar Groovesquid.jar' via the command line to get it up and running)</li>
</ul>
<p>Success!</p>
<p>The only minor complexity might be if you have more than 200 songs,
you'll need to split it up when pasting into groovylist but that's
pretty easy to do.</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
