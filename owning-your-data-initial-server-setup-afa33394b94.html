<p>So before you can move to your own self-hosted services, you'll need
your own hosting. This is a really basic tutorial/set of links on
getting a server up and running with Salt.</p>
<h3>Hosting Provider</h3>
<p>DigitalOcean is a terrific hosting company if you're want to play around with a few personal servers. Here's the pro's list.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's really cost effective.</li>
<li>The UI is super basic.</li>
<li>They have great tutorials for beginners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How safe is DigitalOcean?</h3>
<p>Well, this is a call you'll need to make yourself. They are a New York
based hosting company so that's not so good. However, you can deploy
droplets(servers) in Amsterdam which CEO Ben Uretsky stated should make
snooping harder. It's hardly a ringing endorsement.</p>
<h3>Safer alternatives</h3>
<p>If you want to go a more untraceable route, look for a hosting provider
that'll take Bitcoin. Don't supply any personal information and if
possible only connect to the server through a VPN. Here's a few
examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>BitcoinWebHosting</li>
<li>NameCheap</li>
<li>Incloudibly Zurich based making it even safer, but also far more expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting Up the Server</h3>
<p>DigitalOcean themselves have agreat guide on setting up your first
server and do a great job of explaining what the settings mean and the effect
they have. Even if you don't go with DigitalOcean it's a recommended read.
In terms of settings I'd recommend using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bit or 64bit
depending on how much RAM you give your machine. 12.04 LTS is the last
Long Term Support release of Ubuntu, so you will get updates till late
2017.</p>
<p>If you're more comfortable with servers Debian is an alternative OS that
is admittedly a little safer. Ubuntu contains some proprietary software
and potentially unsafe opt-ins but that's mostly pertaining to the
desktop. DigitalOcean tends to provide more Ubuntu documentation to beginners so it makes a good starter OS, so you can get comfortable with Ubuntu now then transition to Debian later, with a little help from salt(which I'll go into later).</p>
<p>I'd also recommend going with around 1GB of Ram if you intend to use the
server for multiple features, for example mail server, file server,
photo sharing etc. The tutorial also goes into how to connect to your box so by the end of the tutorial you should have a server up and running and be connected via the terminal prompt.</p>
<h3>Setting up Salt</h3>
<p>Salt is an infrastructure management software, but don't let that put
you off. We won't be using about 90% of what Salt does, just a few
features here and there to get you up to speed faster. To explain, these
guides rely on Salt to allow you to quickly configure your servers based
on configurations I've already made, there's no need to worry too much
about how Salt works. Generally you'll just need to copy certain files
and run a command or two, should be pretty straight-forward.
Anyway, yet again I'll leverage a DigitalOcean guide. Here's how to
install Salt on Ubuntu 12.04.</p>
<h3>Done?</h3>
<p>Excellent, you're on your way. Checkout here to choose what
service you want to swap across to your awesome new machine!</p>
