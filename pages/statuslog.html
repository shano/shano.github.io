          <li>
            <strong>2024-04-14</strong>: <p>🤖 My 4-year-old and I have been playing Cubetto lately, it's been a really nice way to teach coding without a screen. Having a physical robot move is a very tactile and satisfying debug cycle for my little one, he loves it! https://www.primotoys.com/</p>
          </li>
          <li>

            <strong>2024-04-04</strong>: <p>🎵 Say what you will about Apple, I'm super impressed the Music app supports syncing Music, Movies, Podcasts, TV Shows and Audiobooks to my 5th Generation iPod introduced on October 12, 2005.</p>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2024-01-30</strong>: <p>✨ My corne mechanical keyboard broke several months ago. The thought of desoldering a bunch of chips makes me very sad. Lesson learned to have a case that prevents the ports from wiggling. Apparently I don’t know better. 🤦‍♂️</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2024-01-02</strong>: <p>🚀 Launch Alert: Platform Engineering Monthly</p>

          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-26</strong>: <p>👨‍💻 I made Code Capsule a small little container dev environment I can hop onto so I don't pollute my OS. Has been useful while I'm doing personal projects on a work laptop. https://github.com/shano/code-capsule</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-25</strong>: <p>✨ I am "sudoku in bed on a backlight e-ink screen is a game changer" years old.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-25</strong>: <p>✨ Got a travelers notebook for Christmas. Very excited to assemble a new note-taking system.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-25</strong>: <p>✨ Merry Christmas everyone, I hope you're having a weird and wonderful holiday!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-24</strong>: <p>✨ I am testing out a stupidly complicated way to update my status.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-24</strong>: <p>✨ I'm updating this from my Kindle Scribe.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-24</strong>: <p>✨ How it works is I share a note using my kindle scribe, the email is forwarded to Amazon SES which invokes a Lambda that extracts the text and updates my status using the API.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-12-24</strong>: <p>✨ The santa from the original Miracle on 34ᵗʰ street doesn't take any crap, he's just threatened to beat a drunk with his cane!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-08-30</strong>: <p>✨ What a fun way to learn a programming language! https://play.elevatorsaga.com</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-07-24</strong>: <p>😬 I wrote a bit of a cynical rant on TikTok...  https://blog.sedd.dev/2023/07/from-tiktok-to-tedium-the-rise-of-npc-streaming-and-the-death-of-our-attention-spans</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-06-30</strong>: <p>❌ Finally, deleted my 14-year-old Reddit account. I'm not even angry or surprised about the API changes, I just felt it was enough of a push to delete my account and move on.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-06-05</strong>: <p>🕺 Nice! I'm  getting one of the early dev beepberry devices. Currently working on a way to boot the OS up in qemu and measure the times. Hoping I can easily test boot flags and see if I can reduce. Any feedback welcome! https://github.com/beeper/beepberry/pull/5/files</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-05-20</strong>: <p>📱 Ordered myself up a beepberry. Already starting some CLI projects for it. https://beepberry.sqfmi.com/</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-30</strong>: <p>✨ Playing Command and Conquer Remastered. Not sure if they remasted the soundtrack too, but it's absolutely banging!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-12</strong>: <p>💻 Made a new Awesome Backstage list in Github, hopefully it's helpful to others! <a href="https://github.com/shano/awesome-backstage">shano/awesome-backstage: 📋 A curated list of awesome Backstage resources!</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-09</strong>: <p>📷 Set up a private pixelfed server using Terraform and AWS Lightsail for sharing photos with family. The UI is really great, highly recommend it! https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-07</strong>: <p>🤔 Let's see if the social.lol integration is working.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-07</strong>: <p>✨ Engineers that depend on well defined public interfaces, I expect ChatGPT will make you very productive. I had some weird requirements around figuring out when resources in a AWS CFN Stack are relied upon outside the stack. ChatGPT made a great start!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-05</strong>: <p>💢 Trying moa.party to cross post to Twitter from Mastodon, mostly so I never have to log into Twitter.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-02</strong>: <p>🥳 Nice! My keymap was merged into the qmk firmware. Say hello to md40! https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/md40</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-04-02</strong>: <p>😮 Last night in bed on my phone,  with ChatGPT and a Python IDE, I wrote a script that pulls down all the weeks events from my Caldav server, writes those events to a PDF and emails it to my kindle scribe via SMTP so I can do late night planning without a phone. On my phone! ChatGPT if anything has made me far more creative. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-03-01</strong>: <p>🕹️ Joystick</p>
<p>15 years later, I finally managed to complete Hotel Dusk for the NDS. Great game, now I need to find a reasonably priced copy of the sequel on eBay.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-02-02</strong>: <p>💭 Using ChatGPT, autokey and a hacky python script (that ChatGPT mostly generated) to write prompts anywhere on my computer and have ChatGPT autofill it. Feels like I'm operating in big-brain mode.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-02-01</strong>: <p>⌨️ The only way to get on with a programmable keyboard is to define your own layout. I swear my layout is the only logical way, which I assume is how everyone else feels. My mega short guide is here: https://shanedowling.com/knowledge-garden/#/page/crkbd</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-30</strong>: <p>💵 Saved myself $20 per month by moving from obsidian publish to logseq with a github action for my knowledgebase. Nice! New garden here! https://shanedowling.com/knowledge-garden/#/page/homepage</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-24</strong>: <p>🤢 You know what's fun? The norovirus and a cold at the same time. My mind and body struggling to comprehend all the misery inputs right now.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-22</strong>: <p>😬 I'm not sure what's sadder, my kid's breakfast cereal is offering a prize of a year's free heating or that it would barely cover half our projected annual heating bill.....</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-21</strong>: <p>💲 Replacing https://kagi.com with a self-hosted instance of whoogle. Kagi is great it's just hard to justify the price.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-20</strong>: <p>😕 A new keyboard layout makes everything difficult, proven by the fact that this is my second attempt at this status....</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-20</strong>: <p>🎉 Woo new domain name, long live sedd.dev</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-18</strong>: <p>🤔 I need to try out https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku on my crkbd.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-15</strong>: <p>smile Nothing more renewing than spending a night alone in a forest. Feels great to do every so often.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-08</strong>: <p>😍 Despite all the horrendous privacy concerns, the Kindle Scribe is my favourite piece of tech in the last few years (aside from the GPD Pocket).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-08</strong>: <p>👀 Does bode well for my plans after so many years as an IC.... <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34290539">Excess management is costing the U.S. $3T per year (2016) | Hacker News</a>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-06</strong>: <p>💢 CircleCI is the latest in a series of hacks targets, supply chain attacks are just the new norm. Let's hope the 17% of those layed-off, none were security teams.. https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/ . Fun times!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-06</strong>: <p>🤦 Hey look a CircleCI PM that works in security and data privacy looking for a new role 29 days ago... https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33901414</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023-01-06</strong>: <p>💤 Somehow, despite only working 3 days, it's felt like a long, long week.</p>
