<p>Recently I read a very interesting <a href="https://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/one-dimensional-man-mini-tutorial-part.html">mini-tutorial on Marcuse</a>
and his book One-Dimensional Man, an apparently brilliant merge of both
Freud and Marx. I'd suggest reading the link and forming you're own
opinions on him. I myself found the tutorial brought on convincing
points, but more than that I found myself falling back a re-ignition of
my own rambling interest in philosophy.</p>
<p>Having been away from it for quite some time, it was nice to put another
filter onto reality, to take a political or socio-economic theory, sit
it behind my eyes and consider the world around me. If it's worth
reading I almost always gain new insights and it helps to formalise my
viewpoints and more importantly take action. I'm well aware I'm not
nearly smart enough to contribute to such a debate but I can make
significant personal decisions with a renewed clarity. Mindfulness is a
wonderful thing, but I'm beginning to realise more and more there's an
extension to this. Not as a directly similar practice but a value in
deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Much like the mind-body awareness a daily meditation practice brings, we
are also within structures, processes and systems that demand our
awareness and not simply passive acceptance at face value. Do this and
we risk getting swept up into the norms and that's an easy way to get
manipulated without even realising it. Confused? Check out the link and
you'll understand.</p>
