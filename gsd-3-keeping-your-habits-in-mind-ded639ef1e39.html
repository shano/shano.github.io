    <p>So you've removed your distractions and figured out how to maintain
focus. You've a set of good habits you'd like to being implementing.
Well firstly, read <a href="https://zenhabits.net/sticky/">this</a>. Don't jump head first into habits you've never gone through before. You're expectations will be too high and sadly, you'll likely fail. Patience is a virtue.
So, after you've chosen the habit you'd like to begin with, here are
some tools to help keep you focused on those good habits.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.amimetic.habits">Habit Streak</a> - This app helps you achieve your goals with daily habit reminders. The focus here is on streaks. Define habits you can achieve everyday. Personally I find slightly vague is good. For example I don't intend to run everyday(you need downtime from running), so instead I have a habit to exercise everyday. So I alternate running with strength exercises.</li>
<li>Cron-Jobs - Yup, straight up cron-jobs are a great way to remind you to keep your good habits in mind. Make sure you have zenity installed and add this to your local cron with crontab -e. I also use cronjobs to automatically shut down my computer in the evening to prevent me working late and to properly wind-down ensuring a good sleep habit.</li>
</ul>
