    <p>I have terrible, terrible impulse control. I cannot stop using my phone
as a distraction tool. I simply cannot. We can discuss willpower, or
being a better person, but they don’t work. I have no willpower and
remain a terrible person despite how hard I try. If my phone can do
something to distract me, I will use it, a lot. Then the loathing sets
in.</p>
<p>So I needed to turn my super sweet iPhone into something entirely
distraction-less and boring, it’s that, or I throw my phone away(which
I’ve seriously considered but without Whatsapp I just cannot communicate
easily with my family and that is not something I want to add friction
to).</p>
<p>So here’s my approach to blocking the noise. (Note: This if for iPhone,
I’m sure Android can do something similar, it’s not like the bulk of
Google’s revenue is tied to you constantly engaging with their
services).</p>

<p>So basically boring tools and Whatsapp. Nothing here would particularly
compel me to check my phone every ten minutes for any sort of update.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-disable-stuff-and-keep-them-disabled">
<h2>How do I disable stuff and keep them disabled?</h2>
<p>This is all great, but I’m a terrible person and once I’ve uninstalled
all of that stuff, I’m basically going to re-installed it all in 5
minutes when terrible me reappears. My solution is lock myself out of my
own phone. Find someone you trust (or if you want these restrictions for
life, someone who hates you) for this process. Here’s how.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Uninstall all of the distracting, time-wasting apps you want to
remove.</li>
<li>Under Settings, in “Content and Privacy Restrictions”, enable it.</li>
<li>Get your friend/enemy to set a password that <strong>you don’t know</strong> but
that <strong>they will remember</strong>.</li>
<li>Under “Allowed Apps”, disable Safari.</li>
<li>Under “Content Restrictions”, disable installing apps.</li>
<li>Search “Color Filters” in Settings and turn on “Greyscale”</li>
</ol>
<p>Woo! We have a drab boring soulless rectangle that gives me exciting
access to my bank.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="replacements">
<h2>Replacements</h2>
<p>So we can talk about getting rid of all of this stuff, but in the end,
if you don’t come up with replacements to that pull for distraction
you’re likely going to crack, beg your friend for the password and
reinstall again. I did, many times. What I needed was replacements and
these seem to have tenuously worked pretty well so far for me.</p>
<p>My replacements are mostly a kindle and a notebook. Kindle to keep me
entertained when my brain, you know, starts to contemplate things like
life and its lack of meaning or cancer or why good things happen to bad
people. The notebook is for habit reminders, todos and when I get that
pull towards the rectangle to search for a thing. When I’m drawn to
research something, instead of the usual reinstall-fest, I write it down
what I want in my notebook and look it up later on a laptop if it still
matters(it often doesn’t).</p>
