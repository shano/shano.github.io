    <p>So the final process I use to help me get shit done is reviewing. Each
week I do a fairly lengthy review of the last week. I see what habits
have been successful and which have been a struggle to maintain. I look
to see if there are appropriate alterations I can use to help improve.
Here's a list of the things I tend to analyse while reviewing, and the
questions I've asked.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> - What have I procrastinated on this week? What peak times do I tend to be productive on my computer and when are the troughs? Can I replace this behavior with something slightly more useful?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.habitstreak.com/">Habit Streak</a> - This one I find very important. What habits have I maintained and what have failed? I ask myself in a gentle self-analytical way why I couldn't maintain certain habits and what conditions I can change to improve my chances. Maybe the habits are simply not maintainable? Do I need to stop others and make specific time for new ones? Should I change my schedule? Reviewing is key to maintaining habits like these and the app I use is really straight-forward, exactly what I need.</li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep">Sleep as Android</a>— Am I still maintaining a good sleep habit? Sometimes I try alterations to my routine and work out if there's a positive or negative effect to my day.</li>
<li>Todo List -I just use a notepad and sometimes just dump ideas into Evernote. At the end of the week I collect them up and add them to a todo list or ditch them. Saying no and not indulging ideas you simply don't have time for it key to this.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> - I do some gardening to my reading list and dump anything I felt may have been a valuable read at the time but on reflection isn't. I have a tendency to throw everything and the kitchen sink at my reading list, so purging this down is essential.</li>
<li>Gratefulness - I add in the things that I'm grateful for from the last week. Typically I try write these moments down during the week. It helps to re-affirm the things you find important and appreciate. By doing it and keeping the things you're grateful for in your mind it helps the review become a more decisive and straightforward process, especially when you have a tendency to hang on to those ideas or wandering thoughts that really have no value.</li>
<li>Projects - What progress have I made in the last week? How has it stacked up compared to other weeks? Did I have a fluid week or was there blockers, how can I approach these if they occur again?</li>
<li>Contacts - Are there contacts or people I've met recently that I wish to catch up or meet again?</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally this is a rough list of what I look at and I've found the
process very revealing and incredibly useful. It provides me with a
framework that has kept me focused on my longer-term goals but also on my general health and how I can potentially make systematic improvements in smaller ways on a regular basis. These improvements will accrue and the benefits over time can be phenomenal.</p>
