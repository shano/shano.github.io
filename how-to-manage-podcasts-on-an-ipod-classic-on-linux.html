  <div>
    <p>After my last post generated some interesting discussion on <a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30236251">Hacker
News</a>, I figured it
was worth a little guide on how I manage my iPod Classic on a Linux
machine. Thankfully some very clever people put together the drivers and
software to make this a breeze, but there's a few things you need to
know that took some figuring out for me. So I'll share them here.</p>
<div class="section" id="connecting-your-ipod">
<h2>Connecting your iPod</h2>
<p>This should be the easiest thing to do. Simply connect your iPod to your
machine and it should appear as an external device. Here's my iPod
appearing under Thunar after I plug it in:</p>
<img alt="" src="./images/ipod_thunar.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="managing-podcasts">
<h2>Managing Podcasts</h2>
<p>To manage podcasts on my laptop I use
<a class="reference external" href="https://gpodder.github.io/">gPodder</a>. I'm a huge fan of it. The only
limitation really is there may be podcasts locked to sources like
Spotify, but if you're listening to Podcasts on an iPod you'll hit this
limitation whatever you do. A quick `sudo apt install gpodder` should
install it on most debian-based systems.</p>
<img alt="" src="./images/gpodder.png" />
<p>So grab some decent Podcasts via RSS and download them. On my machine
the media files will appear under `~/gPodder/Downloads`</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-podcasts-to-your-ipod">
<h2>Adding Podcasts to your iPod</h2>
<p>Once they're downloaded, it's time to add these Podcasts to your iPod,
for this we need <a class="reference external" href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Gtkpod?lang=en">gtkpod</a>.
Again a `sudo apt install gtkpod` should do the job in terms of
installation.</p>
<p>This is what it should look like once you've started gtkpod and
connected your iPod.</p>
<img alt="" src="./images/gtkpod_initial.png" />
<p>You should already have a Podcasts playlist in gtkpod, if not you will
need to create it. Once you do, this is the playlist to add media to and
any media added will then be recognised as Podcasts on your iPod. If you
don't, it gets lost in your larger media collection(and it won't have
resume support). Next step is to start adding Podcasts to your playlist.
You only need to do this once, then it's just a case of syncing your
media. So highlight the Podcasts playlist like so:</p>
<img alt="" src="./images/gtkpod_highlight_podcasts.png" />
<p>then in the menu bar, hit &quot;Music&quot; then &quot;Add Folder&quot; and select the
folder where gPodder downloaded your Podcasts to.</p>
<img alt="" src="./images/gtkpod_add_folder.png" />
<p>It should start processing your files and adding them to your iPod. It
might be a bit unresponsive for a while. Repeat for any Podcasts you
want to add, making sure you add these folders to the Podcast playlist
in gtkpod. When done, make sure to eject your iPod in gtkpod, then eject
it from your filesystem. Podcasts should now appear on your iPod!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-going-podcast-management">
<h2>On-going Podcast management</h2>
<p>Now that your folders have been added, gtkpod will remember to look in
these locations next time so when you want to grab any new Podcast
episodes and sync them to your iPod, it's pretty simple.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open up gPodder and it will check for any new episodes and ask you if
you wish to download them. Use the time to delete any old episodes of
Podcasts you've already listened to.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, mount your iPod, open gtkpod right click on your
Podcasts playlist and hit &quot;Sync Playlist with dir(s)&quot;, it'll give you
a prompt to say which files with be added and removed. Hit okay and
your iPod will be up to date.</li>
</ol>
<img alt="" src="./images/ipod_sayer.jpeg" />
<p>And that's my process, if you have any suggestion for how you do this
better, <a class="reference external" href="https://shanedowling.com/pages/contact.html">let me know</a>!</p>
