<p>I'll keep this one short, because there's a million and one articles about people walking away from the social network. People are writing like they're revolutionaries leading the mass exodus. I even poked fun at it in my <a href="http://139.59.171.97/2014/01/25/internet-predictions-2014/">internet predictions</a>. Anyway, at the start of the year I figured I'd give a month away from facebook a try, partially inspired by Leo Babuta's <a href="https://zenhabits.net/without/">A Year of Living Without</a>.</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>I asked myself what value I was actually getting from the service. If I
can't be bothered ringing someone and catching up, then realistically
why would I waste time liking their cat photos? I also questioned the
value of these facebook friends. Am I actually friends with all these
people or is the connection just convenient enough for me to keep them
around? Do I actually want to share something with them or am I just
boasting?
Again, this topic has been discussed ad nauseam, but I'll link <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/08/19/213568763/researchers-facebook-makes-us-sadder-and-less-satisfied">this article</a> and quote it's final line, "Direct interactions with other human beings led people to feel better". Again, the article is based on one study, but it adds evidence to a belief I've held for quite some time.</p>
<h3>Net Effects</h3>
<p>Nothing negative, at all. At no point during this month have I
felt a desire to return to Facebook. Frankly, I love not knowing. It was
very similar sensation to when I stopped following sensationalist media,
my life just gained a little more space. If you're still on the fence
consider de-activating for a month and seeing how much you really miss
it. You can easily re-activate your account any time you want. For me,
put simply I won't be going back.</p>
<p><strong>February 28, 2014</strong> - Counterfeit Update - Still off
Facebook, still not regretting the decision.
<strong>February 14, 2015</strong> - Still haven't touched the site. Much to my
benefit.</p>
