into Secular Buddhism. I have to admit, the results aren’t so promising,
many are so vague as to be almost completely useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for Buddhism minus beliefs, what I keep seeing is much …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2020-11-07:/the-vagueness-of-secular-buddhism.html</guid><category>Mindfulness</category></item><item><title>Four years without Facebook</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/four-years-without-facebook-7d5285a25913.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__gvkmxCDjT7hqaHPPWYsovg__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to see the media dog-piling on Facebook so much lately. None of this 'news' seems to actually be conveying much that's new, more that it's started taking what was slowly becoming normalised and framed it in a way to highlight the outrage. I don't particularly like the media's …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 18:06:17 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2018-03-26:/four-years-without-facebook-7d5285a25913.html</guid><category>Mindfulness</category></item><item><title>Leaving no Trace</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/leaving-no-trace-6ca31ffc0b9.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__ybl2a5U__z3REr1FD8qv09Q__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was camping along the West Coast of the US, I heard about the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_No_Trace"&gt;Leave No Trace&lt;/a&gt; movement and found the idea very much resonated with me. Recently, I've found myself looking around day to day and wondering where I could start leaving less of a trace. We can …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:26:05 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2018-03-19:/leaving-no-trace-6ca31ffc0b9.html</guid><category>Mindfulness</category></item><item><title>10 lessons from 150 days of meditation</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/10-lessons-from-150-days-of-meditation-b4976d062a20.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__GBwIzkZphZlN9GeNW3HAEA__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been meditating now for 150 days straight, but even before that I was a fairly regular meditator for many years, I had just never kept up with any sort of meaningful streak every single day. My current momentum started from a difficult period in my life and even once …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2018 22:06:05 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2018-03-14:/10-lessons-from-150-days-of-meditation-b4976d062a20.html</guid><category>Mindfulness</category></item><item><title>Promoting mindfulness through the day</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/promoting-mindfulness-through-the-day-e294cbc78843.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I've been cultivating a mindfulness habit. Overall,
it has delivered great results. One of the aspects I've been less than
happy with however, is my ability to carry that mindful state with me
throughout the day. I'm unsure if it's because I'm a programmer and my …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2014-01-16:/promoting-mindfulness-through-the-day-e294cbc78843.html</guid><category>Mindfulness</category></item><item><title>Tired meditation</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/tired-meditation-47ed1f094c04.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When I imagine myself doing meditation, I see myself almost leaping out of bed with boundless energy, followed by a full and focused period of breathing exercises. Nothing could be further from the truth. Right now I'm working through the Discovery Series on Headspace and it's focusing more on looking …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2013-07-25:/tired-meditation-47ed1f094c04.html</guid><category>Mindfulness</category></item></channel></rss>
