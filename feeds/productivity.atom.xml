&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I've been working off a varying series of to-do lists to drive my life. I use a mix of the Things app, my bullet journal, and a calendar. Basically, my setup is to have annual Smart Goals, broken down into achievable chunks, then broken down into tasks to knock off todo lists. On the face of it, it's a way to organise a wiggly world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is a wiggly world? Alan Watts describes it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This world is a great wiggly affair. Clouds are wiggly, waters are wiggly, plants are wiggly, mountains are wiggly, people are wiggly. But people are always trying to straighten things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todo lists are essentially another attempt to make wiggly things straight and processable. There's the addictive high of knocking another task off a list, then spending no time actually appreciating what you've accomplished. After you spend months achieving something important, how long does the joy you obtain from completing the activity last? From my experience, maybe a few hours. Essentially the to-do lists can become is just a list of unfulfilled craving with no real end-point in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive is important. From the theory behind Compassion Focused Therapy(CFT), your mind is broken down into three elements of emotional regulation. Drive, Threat and Soothing. All three are essential to living a happy, productive, flourishing life, but issues arise when the balance is skewed one way or another and this is where my concern with todo lists comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__4LBDCrsJSxN2vzhDISELNw__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External threats like losing your job can be helpful so you don't slack off each day at work. There is a functional value to threats like this. However, I'm beginning to think that todo lists are engaging threat into a pit of sorts. In the act of creating a to-do list, your converting your Drive behavior into a sort of Threat based motivation. I feel Drive, so I make these todos, I am then threatening myself into an unfulfilled existence if I don't act on this external list. If balanced, this can work relatively well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems arise when there's too much Drive forcing far too much Threat for you to handle. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors probably found it relatively easy to keep a balanced Drive -&amp;gt; Threat system, where we only kept in our heads a few goals to further enhance our status or gain a mate etc. Think of it like a physical attack, if you have one or two threats, you can make a reasonable estimation and attack/flee accordingly, when you're surrounded by a dozen or so, screw it, you might as well just lie on the ground and let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'm just going try to create a few aims(maybe three or so) each morning and work out, if I'm any more or less productive than I was before or after. No long todo lists, no more guilt over unfulfilled goals. I'm going to look at what my wiggly mind wants to do at each instant, rather than crowbarring in what my driven straight-lined-self wanted me to do a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Freelancer Lessons – Part 3</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/freelancer-lessons-part-3-7015dc89b6fb.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-06T14:54:41+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-06T14:54:41+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2018-01-06:/freelancer-lessons-part-3-7015dc89b6fb.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__Ih__APvHH2mTGl0LL8Uv__kg__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part 3 in a series on lessons I've learned from several years of freelancing. You can find Part 1 &lt;a href="https://medium.com/developer-lessons-from-2017-part-1-14c31f45307c?source=linkShare-c3fb4f3f97d3-1515250377"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Part 2 &lt;a href="https://medium.com/freelancer-lessons-part-2-e5700002d8b?source=linkShare-c3fb4f3f97d3-1515250418"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though you can read these in no specific order really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part 3 in a series on lessons I've learned from several years of freelancing. You can find Part 1 &lt;a href="https://medium.com/developer-lessons-from-2017-part-1-14c31f45307c?source=linkShare-c3fb4f3f97d3-1515250377"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Part 2 &lt;a href="https://medium.com/freelancer-lessons-part-2-e5700002d8b?source=linkShare-c3fb4f3f97d3-1515250418"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though you can read these in no specific order really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watch your mental state&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're working a full-time job, you'll have people around you who will get to know you over time. Professional relationships start to develop, people will start to recognise you 'on a good day' or 'on a bad day' with enough 'bad days' on the trot almost always a caring co-worker or a good boss will check in on you, perhaps help with your workload or just lend an ear to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When contracting, you may want to ensure that you have some sort of support network around the work you do that may not come from your co-workers. You may not be in roles long enough to garner the professional relationships I've mentioned above or perhaps as a contractor there may be a professional distance you want to maintain. The point is when you start to have several 'bad days' in a row, make sure someone is around to recognise and make you aware of it and can talk to you about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having not really having had much of a professional support network and realising its implicit value, one of my main focus points when returning to full time work is to ensure that I am more of a caring co-worker to the people around me and am trying to do a better job of keeping an eye on the well-being of those around me. It's easy for programmers(or knowledge workers in general) to get too focused on solving problems on the screen in front of you, and not lift your head up and check in on the people around you and make sure they're doing okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seek job satisfaction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the underlying lessons I hope I've imparted is that there can be a tendency to prioritise 'the business' over the individual, this point is just to keep in mind how happy you are in your role. One of the benefits to contracting is flexibility, make use of it. Don't like a role? Hop onto something else! As a contractor this is to some extent more expected than a perm employee and right now freelancer programmers can be picky about their roles. I'm certain this won't always be the case, but we may as well enjoy this while it lasts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counterpoint this however, I would also bear in mind that there is always a drive in our society(and technology is no different) to be constantly seeking better, to never be happy with what you have. So if you do want to change roles, perhaps try to understand your underlying reasoning before job hopping. Maybe you don't like only working in PHP or Python or whatever, but does that really bother you or is it the Hacker News posts talking about how better everything is with technology X or Y? PHP, Python, bloody Fortran are all fine to work with if you're challenged and happy in your role, whatever that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simplify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracting can make things complicated… Invoicing, chasing bills, logging receipts, sorting out your next contract, multiple development environments, company environments, accounts, tax returns etc, etc. Just do whatever you can to make it as simple as possible. I hired my own accountant which made things a little easier. I tried using an accountancy software, which didn't make things easier(Unless you're lucky enough to support a very standardised approach to invoicing and billing the accounting systems won't be of much use). The point is, try things, does it make things easier? Then keep it, if not discard. Life's complicated enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of actual app/sites I used, I found I stuck to tools that were either very flexible or did one very specific thing well. In the end I used &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/"&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/a&gt; for invoicing, as well as tracking income and &lt;a href="https://1tapreceipts.com"&gt;1Tap Receipts&lt;/a&gt; for tracking my expenses, then emailed the whole ball of stuff to my accountant to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working from home is not all it's cracked up to be&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This topic is a biggie, it's one I might dedicate several posts to. Put in the most simple terms, every other point I've listed above can be compounded and its effects can be worsened by working from home. I'll link to my future posts here about the pitfalls I faced working from home. Right now just bear in mind, for many it may not be the promised working utopia we were all told it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To sum it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the realisations I've slowly(and sometimes painfully) gained are of some use to future/existing freelancers. Despite all of this, I think freelancing still can be a great way to work if you think it might suit you. For me, it has completely shifted how I perceive my work day to day and has also made me appreciate the many advantages there are to regular old full-time work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Freelancer Lessons – Part 2</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/freelancer-lessons-part-2-e5700002d8b.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-01T16:45:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T16:45:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2018-01-01:/freelancer-lessons-part-2-e5700002d8b.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__2AEQoUCrc3CV1JPJNEGr9Q__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on "profits only"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've alluded to this in my previous post, but, now that you're a business, you may start to make decisions that optimise being a business, not a person. It becomes easier to start making decisions that might lead to say personal burnout for the sake of professional business health. Taking holidays was a big one for me, while contracting I never once took as many holidays as my partners mandatory holidays in her full time roles. Knowing your invoices were about to take a big hit next month by taking say, two weeks off will always be hanging over your head. Even if you've calculated that you would get paid a whole lot more over an annual period if you took a bunch of holidays while contacting when decision time comes for that month, it can be tough to make the call to take that time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another "effective business decision" might be to jump on clearly bad idea projects for a higher day rate. You become less important in relation to "the business". It takes effective higher level, long term thinking to ensure that profits are not the only metric to measure success against.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dealing with money really sucks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I've never been completely burned over invoicing issues(though many others have), late payments of invoices were shockingly regular. Perhaps there's a better way to punish/promote better payment schedules, but I found trying to propose such things with clients difficult and awkward, often you need to be flexible to make it worth the effort to onboard you in the first place and offering punishing late payment terms seemed to get in the way, I regret that decision looking back. Had I known how often late payments would occur, I would have used a late payment penalty fee as a metric to determine whether a future client would cause issues. As I said before, I always had more work than time, and should have refused more contracts. There were several occasions where I wanted to keep a client happy several months after officially finishing work with them as they still had outstanding invoices to be paid, this is not a good way to work. One advantage to multiple clients is though is that you can hedge your bets and perhaps live from the income of one client while waiting for late payments from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other burden with money is obviously having to submit your own tax returns, even with an accountant I found the whole process particularly stressful each year. Being a developer, you often want to know the ins and outs of things before proceeding, however tax law is often non-obvious and confusing, leading you down paths where you don't know how to proceed. Even with my accountant, we ran into complications where the answers should have been straightforward but aren't. Being a remote developer often working for several companies in different countries it was perhaps not a well trodden path and both HMRC and the accountants I worked with could do a better job understanding/sharing the information required. A lot of contractors in the UK create their own company as a way of reducing their tax burden, this can be complicated and cause issues with IR35 legislation if you are working for the same client for a long period of time. Despite being almost certain I was legally fine doing this, I decided instead to remain self employed as, frankly, I wanted to pay taxes(crazy I know) as it felt like the most honest approach. Part of me wishes I've gone down the company route, simply as it probably would have been more straightforward and liabilities would be tied up in the company not myself as an individual, but perhaps it was for the best as leaving/shutting down such a setup can be quite complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Not stagnating on tech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to bear in mind in terms of the technologies you work with, there often is excellent money in working with niche technologies, I can personally attest to that. The issue might come up however that the demand for such skills might dry up or (what happened with myself), you grow tired of working with a particular niche technology and simply want to move on. Ensure you maintain a broader set of skills so you can hop out of that niche into a variety of roles if the market/your interests change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The cost of seeking work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was never really an issue for me, finding work through contacts from previous roles meant that there has been always more work than time for me and I often had to turn potential offers down, but if you're not in such a position having to regularly seek work and the stress involved in role changing can become an issue. Be wary of this and perhaps have a system in place for when it's time to hunt for that new contract(or ideally several weeks or months before your current contract is due to end), in the end this will alleviate a lot of the stress and burden of finding new contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next is the final post in this series, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/freelancer-lessons-part-3-7015dc89b6fb?source=linkShare-c3fb4f3f97d3-1515250509"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Freelancer lessons – Part 1</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/developer-lessons-from-2017-part-1-14c31f45307c.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-31T19:20:04+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-31T19:20:04+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2017-12-31:/developer-lessons-from-2017-part-1-14c31f45307c.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__T29vR6I4G8K__edEp81oWCQ__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on this year, many of the lessons I've learned had less to do with specific technologies and more to do with long term career growth. I've been a developer now for 9 years and as a result, I'm starting to think more about longer term goals and happiness …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__T29vR6I4G8K__edEp81oWCQ__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on this year, many of the lessons I've learned had less to do with specific technologies and more to do with long term career growth. I've been a developer now for 9 years and as a result, I'm starting to think more about longer term goals and happiness. As a result I made the decision to move from contracting back to full time work towards the tail end of the year so a lot of my reflections are tied around the costs of short term thinking and contracting in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Money isn't everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is an obvious one, but it was a lesson slowly learned for me. I've been a contractor for the past few years and while it has had some highlights and excellent roles there is definitely a price to pay being a contractor. At the end of the year I dropped my contracts and have moved back into a full time position. There were several reasons for this, many of which are outlined below. It was tough to leave the contractor lifestyle, it will almost always pay better than full time work, there's a certain flexibility to it, you hop between multiple projects and that can keep things interesting. The key takeaway this year was that most of those benefits were slowly getting outweighed by negatives and the only thing keeping me contracting was high day rates and in the end I had to make the call to leave, money wasn't worth the overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep it to one company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last three years I have been contracting for either two or three companies simultaneously. I tended to draw higher day rates when I split my week between clients. Often clients simply need a top-up developer to help out with smaller projects while also not becoming an irreplaceable member of the team, it makes sense in terms of managing contractors. However there are issues with this setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the cognitive overhead. Swapping 2 or 3 times a week between not only different tech, different team members, processes, documentation, heck even different email providers and ticketing systems has a higher long term cognitive overhead than one might expect. Initially, there might be no issues with such a setup, but over time the constant churn of swapping will create a productivity hit. There's simply too much variability to focus as effectively on what your being hired to do. It also has the cumulative effect alongside the huge gaps between work. I might be halfway through a task and not get a chance to return to working on it for another 5 or 6 days, between which I've worked at multiple locations on different teams in different companies all likely with different tech. Anyone who believes there won't be a cognitive cost(I include my past self in that group) is deluding themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second major issue is that clients bleed into one another. Be wary of clients where you're the only subject matter expert for a particular technology. There can be definite expectations that when an issue arises you'll take care of it despite working for another client that day. The stress levels of managing such a situation can be high, as you try to manage the expectations of multiple clients at once, and again this takes away from your focus on the job, which is not what you want when you live or die based on solidly productive days to justify your day rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is further more subtle issues that arise with simultaneous contracts, but these are the main ones that lead me to believe that if your want to stay more focused, have a higher output and be day to day happier try to focus on one client only if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The team matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about contracting is that you may end up working for companies that might not have the best team structure. That they need contractors to supplement their internal resources may indicate a staffing issue which can be for various reasons, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule and you can also certainly work with poor teams while working full time, it's simply that there can be a tendency to prioritise the higher payoff over good working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single thing I focused on when moving to a full time position was working within a good team and getting a good feeling from technical and non-technical leadership within the company. This was simply the most important motivator for me and I highly doubt I'll ever regret using this as my barometer for finding my current position or future positions for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Temporary decision-making leading to long term costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never had a client end a contract, it was always on me to move onto something else. As a contractor you might expect to work a 6 month contract, have it end, then move on. This belief can lead to short term decision making. For example, when you literally have a choice between a good and a bad team but there's a twofold increase in your day rate, sacrificing your day to day happiness is a legitimate option as these decisions all to some extent feel like temporary measures. The problem is, it has never played out like this for me. Despite taking many short term contracts, the clients always ended up wanting to renew. In a way this makes sense, it can be a pain to replace contractors who have decent internal knowledge, or perhaps the hiring managers plan to replace you has gone awry or it's simply just hard to find reliable developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that you might be making bad long term decisions while believing them to be short term ones and it can be easier to stick around somewhere because your comfortable and perhaps don't have the energy levels to make a switch right now. The lesson here is simply to be wary of short term thinking, as it can easily play out over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I've written on another site how I use Rescuetime to provide metrics on my overall productivity that I can review each week. One useful feature I noticed was Rescuetime highlights, which gives you a good overview of your accompishments throughout the day. The first thing I wanted to add to this (obviously) was git commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily it turns out someone had already thought of this and implemented
it. The script itself is here, I'm just going to reproduce it below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, the annoying part for me is that this doesn't work globally across
all of my git repos, so to fix this you can leverage git's templates directory.
To create/initialise a git template folder simply run these commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git config — global init.templatedir &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;~/.git_template&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
mkdir -p ~/.git-templates/hooks
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then put the above shell code into ~/.git-templates/hooks/post-commit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that from now on, any new git repos you initialise
will contain this post-hook script. However, if you want to attach this
to existing repos, just run a git init wherever the .git folder is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Bulletproof productivity</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/bulletproof-productivity-c95958f3bbf9.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2015-02-14:/bulletproof-productivity-c95958f3bbf9.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__9xjbAEugp7LzBovSvqZstQ.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months I've been trying different ways to increase my
productivity, specifically during work hours. From todo lists to
pomodoro's, xeffect cards, the autofocus method and even back to GTD.
I've noticed a pattern with a lot of these techniques. They all require
a pile of maintenance and none of them actually give you much in terms
of positive feedback. When you mark a task off a list, you're often not
getting the satisfaction of completion because that task is in the
middle of a huge pile of other tasks you have yet to face. These lists
goal to complete, all lists and systems have done is given me two
problems to solve. The Pomodoro technique especially, the amount of
over-head and tracking you need to do just to discover productivity
trends is painful. How off were your estimates, how many interruptions
did you log last Tuesday, it's all a bit messy and overwhelming after a
while, and difficult to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago Jeff Atwood wrote a post titled &lt;a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/todont/"&gt;Todon't&lt;/a&gt;, which
provides a lot of good reasons why todo lists aren't making you any more
productive and to some extent I agree with him. What I disagree on is
his dismissal of tools. While todo lists might not motivate you much,
there are apps out there to help assist us in focusing on the tasks at
hand. So I'm not about to throw tools out the window yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I was looking for were apps that required almost no maintenance but
would improve your productivity in some way shape or form and after a
fairly exhaustive search I've come across two that together have
increased my personal/work-time productivity by leaps and
bounds(evidence at the end, promise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focus(for Mac)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://heyfocus.com"&gt;Focus&lt;/a&gt; is awesome. It has everything I
could want in a tool to stop my lizard brain from hitting up distraction
sites every ten minutes. It sounds a little like Self-Control in that it
will block certain websites for certain time periods. However, it has a
few other features three of which turn Focus into something far, far
more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it will also block apps, meaning there's no circumventing
unfocused time by say watching a movie or playing video games.
Secondly when you go to a blocked website it will present quotes to try
and motivate you, not just a big "THIS IS BLOCKED" message. Now, I'm a big fan of Stoicism, so I dumped a ton of Stoic quotes in there, so
everytime I try go to reddit, I can't. Now, however I also get Marcus
Aurelius telling me I might die any day now so do the right thing(or
other, better motivation quotes).
Finally there's schedules. This is easily the most powerful feature of
Focus. It allows you to set blocks of time during your days when you
want to be focused, so it's no longer an action you need to take. This
is key, focused can now be the default setting on your computer. Here's
me, trying to unfocus while writing this post. I can't so I guess I
should keep writing. That's fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means when I get up in the morning and try to fire up reddit, Marcus
is shouting at me again. First thing when I get into work, Marcus is
shouting at me again. My default behaviour when I am on a laptop is to
be productive, it changes how you see your computer. It's not the
amazing distraction device it once was. It's a tool for getting stuff
done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I have focus to run from 6am-8pm on workdays(so even after
work I don't just veg out with distracting stuff on my laptop) and it's
9am-6pm on weekends(for movies etc in the evenings). I'm half tempted to
try run it 24/7 for a few weeks and see if I miss the noise. Either way
this app has given me many more productive hours of my life back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rescuetime.com"&gt;Rescuetime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rescuetime has been around a while and at first I was pretty dismissive of it, I mean it has a 'Get Focused' mode that sort of like a poor man's Focus and it has some pretty graphs but why in God's name would I want to maintain this sort of data on everything I do for some graphs? Well, the simple answer is because if you have a brain that's anything like mine, then it's stupid and those graphs will do more for your productivity than a million unread copies of Getting Stuff Done. Rescuetime provides an easy, visual way to compare your productivity over time, and that little productivity score might just begin to matter to you. I've installed the chrome extension, which provides a really handy pop-up of how you're going today and how this compares to your average. If you begin to check this regularly, you'll really begin to care about keeping above your average(then of course your average will increase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__DQGJrB1c3CUHPBMiPoLyjQ.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like the stuff FarmVille does to your brain, but instead of
watering computer plants, you're getting shit done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quantify how effective this has been, here's
my Rescuetime score for the
times between 6am-8pm on the first week of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__z6lkYgi60Pzhd5eH0__pgMw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again this week(2nd week of February).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__2uTLNboch31Xw7QCUzYXvw.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't really argue with those results.
post and want to give it a try, it'd be great if you could use them.

&lt;p&gt;It's been 4 years, 700 questions(with 800 answers) and several server
moves later and by and large the process hasn't changed all that much,
everything is just little more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tagging:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started I simply used tagging to reflect the technology the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tag company sensitive questions with the company name, so if I ever leave that place, I can easily find/drop questions with company sensitive info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of the time, I notice that a solution I'm entering is worthy of a blog post. I tend to flag my questions as to-blog, so when I'm looking for writing inspiration it's pretty easy to start writing when you've got a list of essentially half-complete posts waiting for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I gave internal access my OSQA install to companies I worked for. If I was writing rough documentation for a specific team I would create tags for them to review my "documents" while I was writing them up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scripts:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I stored my scripts with some comments in a standard
~/scripts folder and grep when I needed functionality. This solution
always ended up getting messy to me so I moved them to my OSQA install.
They're much tidier up there personally, I drill-down into the scripts
tag then filter with what I need. Plus OSQA stores every revision of a
question/answer so I can easily peruse old variants. I'm aware git would
solve such a problem, but being able to jump onto a random machine and
grab all my scripts via the web in a standardised way is pretty nice
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quicker Searching:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple fix, essentially I added my OSQA search as a keyword search on
my browser so I can quick search by keyword followed by my search term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future Improvements:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050"&gt;Refactor Your Wetware&lt;/a&gt; one of the recommendations the book gives is to use an Engineer's Log, this is essentially what this OSQA install is, my Engineer's Log. One suggestion the book does it mark an X, every-time you use a solution from your Engineers Log. I want to eventually hack OSQA, so that I can use the Upvote feature myself to flag frequently used solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually I'll add pygments syntax highlighting. 4 years later and I still haven't gotten round to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should probably migrate from an OSQA install to Askbot, considering there doesn't seem to be much of an open source future but my current solution works just fine so I see no need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's about it really, to be honest the lesson here really is that
flexible solutions last.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Perfomance Enhancing Breakfast</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/perfomance-enhancing-breakfast-4a14f17ee20a.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-03-01:/perfomance-enhancing-breakfast-4a14f17ee20a.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__EES2Sqy6g09QG__4Aw5ZAiA.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Lance Armstrong has shown the world, putting the right thing into
your body can greatly improve performance, I myself have been looking
into more maintainable alternative. More and more I'm experimenting with
diet as a means to improve my mental performance as well as my running
ability week on week. Specifically ways of optimising the meals I'm
taking in and turning them into more efficient forms of food
consumption. Looking into my diet was partially kicked off by my recent
foray into fasting and also looking at the spectacular popularity of the
soylent project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where I was&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind I did a little research into how I could turn
breakfast into a more efficient starter meal for the day. Generally I
never eat breakfast, so this seemed like a good place to experiment. The
only breakfast I ever tended to eat was oats, which generally caused me
to feel incredibly hungry long before lunch time, presumably as my
stomach had woken up. I needed a breakfast that was going to solve a few
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The checklist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needed to be fast to make and eat. I generally have a pretty rigid morning routine and I wanted to ensure that if I was going to add in a meal, it would consume too much time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needed to stave off hunger till lunch-time. This was always an on-going pain point for me, so satiety over time way important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supplied my body with materials I needed that complimented my diet. I'm a vegetarian, so protein and iron are a good bet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was reasonably cost effective if I'm going to be eating it everyday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn't taste like death. (Optional, but preferable). I've done beetroot juicing before and I still shudder at the thought of drinking that first thing in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be bought in bulk and be stored for a month-long period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some rudimentary research it because pretty obvious that I
would need something smoothie-based to tackle all the requirements of
the checklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recipe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almond Milk-Lactose free, naturally high in anti-oxidants and minerals. Also provides a drinkable texture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frozen Fruit-Can be bought in bulk and lasts quite a while. High in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Improves taste. I alternate a few ranges of frozen fruit so the specific vitamins and minerals vary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goji Berries-Vitamin A and antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oats-High in fiber and antioxidants. Adds satiety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frozen Spinach-Vitamin A and C and Iron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whey Powder-I opted for a strawberry flavoured one for taste. High in protein and BCAAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Bananas-High in fibre and Potassium. Adds satiety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally all of these ingredients are also low in fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 5 minutes to make/clean up after. Once it's made I go through my normal routines drinking the smoothie without any time affect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I added in the oats it seemed to supply enough to stave off hunger easily till lunch time. It also seems to be one of the only sources of food I can eat post-run that will completely stave off hunger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein and Iron are sorted as well as a ton of vitamins and minerals. The BCAAs are hopefully also helping build up lean muscle while I'm training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial cost of ingredients including a cheap blender was about £50 so not too bad really. Total cost per week never generally goes above £20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tastes really good actually. The frozen fruit/veg keep the temperature down so it's fruit and cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All but the bananas meet this requirement. I go through a fair bit of almond milk too so I generally need to buy both on a weekly basis, which isn't too much of a pain point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found that there is a significant difference between days when I
have the smoothie and days when I don't. It's not the same as say
drinking a coffee, presumably as the effects are more slow burning but
my cognitive ability is definitely higher. As I'm coding each morning I
can generally work out when my brain is hitting limits holding abstract
entities in my head or when I'm in a flow of productivity or not and I
was doing a rough rating each day and put simply, that rating has only
improved. So for me that's my measure of cognitive ability, it may be
different for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I've learned overall is that food is pretty cool and looking into
the specific benefits of the food I'm eating is unsurprisingly
interesting. For me though, the simple fact that changing my diet from
nothing(or maybe a coffee and occasional croissant) to an uber healthy
food source &lt;strong&gt;makes my brain work better&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty incredible. You see
the benefits on paper but until you give it a measurable test you can't
really appreciate it. Give it(or your own version) a go, let me know how
you find it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Cutting caffeine</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/cutting-caffeine-20012941744d.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-02-20:/cutting-caffeine-20012941744d.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__QQVhtNl9A4Ur1ELwN0XHSw__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I read a post on Sebastian Marshall's blog about &lt;a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/a-method-for-reliability-quitting-caffeine"&gt;cutting caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, in which goes into the benefits and a method he uses for quitting coffee. He suggests cycling off it to reset your tolerance every so often. I figured that was a really good idea since I'd gotten to the
point where in the morning I needed a coffee to feel normal, it was a
good time to do something about it. Sebastian's method of taking caffeine pills I found a little extreme. There's a certain aesthetic to drinking coffee that I really enjoy and trying to replace it with green tea and pills wasn't going to work. Sebastian may have a mental strength I simply don't possess so I needed to offset the caffeine with altering the experience much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don't really need to be incredibly specific about the mg doses of
caffeine I'm giving myself, this seemed like a needless complex way off
essentially weaning, so I figured I come up with more maintainable
approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was pretty straight-forward. Simply wind down the amount of caffeinated coffee you drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research the best possible decaf coffee you can source and make sure it's actually decaf. I use a Nespresso machine, so per cup I can accurately see I've moved from around 65mg of caffeine per cup to about 0.4mg. The caffeine database and overcaffeinated should help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simply replace caffeine beverages with decaf. I know it's not the same, but for me, it's close enough. I reduced my daily caffeinated coffee amount by one cup every week and that's it. It's fairly straight-forward. I'm primarily on decaf now and only tend to use caffeine only when I actually need the energy/productivity boost and wow, it's a noticeable boost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, If you want to go totally caffeine free, take a look at Teeccino to wind-down even further. Frankly I didn't bother with this step but you may want to if say you have doctors orders to steer totally clear from caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>A tip for introducing new habits</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/a-tip-for-introducing-new-habits-79186124433a.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-02-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-02-13:/a-tip-for-introducing-new-habits-79186124433a.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading up on &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning"&gt;Pragmatic Thinking and Learning&lt;/a&gt;

I decided I would implement a habit called Morning Pages. Effectively
you commit to writing several pages of writing each and every morning,
for me I intended to write a blog post unit each day, and decide which
ones were worthy enough of sharing towards the end of the week. I was
building up a healthy morning routine and figured one more habit
wouldn't be too much to ask of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed. Repeatedly. Two months in and I'd managed about five totally
random mornings of writing. All of them on weekends. It kept feeling
non-essential compared to my other habits and I felt like the pressure
of getting to work at a reasonable hour build up as I sat down to try
and write. I simply couldn't commit and I couldn't focus on writing.
So, in this sorry state I figured out a great way to introduce new
habits that actually immediately worked for me. &lt;strong&gt;All new habits are
done first.&lt;/strong&gt; Simple as that, whenever you have a routine or when you're about to knuckle down and be productive always start with your newest
habit. It's the one you have the most tenuous hold on and should be
prioritised accordingly until it can become an establish part of your
routine. I've been writing every morning for about a month and a half
now and I've only missed one day(due to extreme tiredness). Also because it's the first thing I do when I wake, I've started to incorporate
dreams into creative writing, it's been very rewarding actually. I think
this habit is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Sleep as the fundamental habit</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/sleep-as-the-fundamental-habit-f9590f13c013.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-01-09:/sleep-as-the-fundamental-habit-f9590f13c013.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__8iAA__DadoqBnceEck3kraw__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically washing your face is like taking painkillers after a
serious injury, it's only painting over the cracks of a deeper problem.
Meditation and mindfulness truly can unlock the potential of your day,
but a good nights rests can even more. Sleep is a physical process that
underlies every waking moment. So to actively take the time to develop
good sleep habits should improve every other aspect in your life,
including meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only began to appreciate a good sleep routine when it was gone. Four
months of hopping from towns, cities and countries has destroyed my good sleeping habits. I can't remember the last time I slept in the same bedmore than two nights in a row. I return to a more permanent base soon enough but even now I'm trying to develop a rough sleep routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing your sleep patterns and logging how you feel is a great way to
discover what works for you. How many hours do you need? When is your ideal wind-down time? Be curious about it. To help I found &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep"&gt;Sleep as Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pzizz.com/"&gt;Pzizz&lt;/a&gt;, they're very helpful but just being curious and exploring your sleeping patterns can do wonders for your well-being. Nailing down a good sleeping habit has been one of the biggest fundamental improvements I've made, everything flows from there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>GYPYSs and unrealistic expectations</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/gypyss-and-unrealistic-expectations-f67a4927d9d6.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-01-01:/gypyss-and-unrealistic-expectations-f67a4927d9d6.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/generation-y-unhappy_b_3930620.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; was shared with me recently, it's an excellent read and provides some good reasoning for why people feel that vague sense of living an unaccomplished life.

I'll admit it, I am most definitely a Gypsy. My garden right now it full of flowers of unrealistic expectations. I'd begun to discover this while meditating and watching my emotions daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__dgV1eOnLLrwiaafzuZ__klg__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.headspace.com/"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; there's a section called the discovery series. You begin to focus on watching your emotions throughout the day and when your mind gets distracted and wanders. More specifically you watch the ways in which you wish things were different. You begin to notice the gulf between reality and fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I spotted the fantasties and dismissed them entirely. I was
disappointed in myself for being so ridiculous and unrealistic. However,
soon enough I realised that those fantasties had some utility. They
could potentially shape long term goals. In &lt;a href="https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning"&gt;Pragmatic Thinking and
Learning&lt;/a&gt; (a book I'd highly recommend), there is a concept called the Pragmatic Investment Plan, where you essentially break down your longer term goals into where you want to be in say 5 years time and that's broken down into where you want to be in a year and what tasks can you do right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a wild guess at where I found the inspiration for where I wanted to
be in 5 years time? It's pretty fun breaking down some of your dreams
into a potentially attainable setting of SMART goals. Say you've started to get into drawing and you want others to see and possibly be moved by your work. Right now you still suck but you dream of the day when something you created was in a gallery or an exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you've found your five year SMART goal. You could have year one be to create a blog and regularly publish a new piece of work. The thing right now you could do is grab that drawing book you held off buying. If nothing else, it's a start. A few months down the line you might realise you're not that into drawing or you're totally into it. Either way to get to that point and either fulfill or dismiss the fantasy it starts with trying it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, we all fantasise about about the craziest things and it's
sometimes even embarrassing, but there's real insight there. Sit down
with these fantasies and break them down into attainable chunks, then
act on those chunks. You'll get a hell of a lot farther than just
sitting there wishing things were different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Performance gains by altering your routine</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/performance-gains-by-altering-your-routine-f44365b8972b.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-12-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2013-12-30:/performance-gains-by-altering-your-routine-f44365b8972b.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the mornings I had a very structured routine.

do is meditate as for me, all other habits flow from this. Then after my
meditation I would either go for a run or do some dumbbell based
strength exercises. The reasoning being that as exercising was also a
quiet periods, I could try extending the mindfulness and clarity gained
from meditation into my exercises and have a better chance of remaining mindful throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, this routine has worked out exactly the same every time.
Meaning that I would always feel somewhat tired while meditating and a niggling doubt would re-occur that I was too tired to perform my
meditations effectively. You get a lot of space to dwell on these doubts
while meditating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a response, for a few days I started to exercise before meditation
and I must admit the effect were dramatic. Meditation after running is
akin to trying to focus after taking a pile of happy pills. The
meditation feels better, it seems easier and I'm very positive
throughout the whole experience. I also discovered that meditation
following exercise is a great way to generate ideas. Especially with
writing, I permanently feel like I'm going to run out of ideas but when
you fill yourself with positive energy and then try to sit and think,
the ideas just seemed to flow. It could be simply a mixture of
endorphines being positivity and physical tiredness taking away fears of
having bad idea, whatever it is it seems to be the ideal mental state
for idea generating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this all sounds very positive but I must admit this alteration of
my routine will only be used sparingly. Firstly, I got distracted quite
a lot with ideas during the meditation, forcing me to write them down
and effectively breaking my focus. Some my my hand would be completely covered in pen marks after a meditation. That's great, every so often but it got frustrating pretty quickly having to break focus over and over. Secondly, it's wonderful to watch your breath while you're full of positive "I love life" energy but that's not exactly reflective of my
mood throughout the day and when your hope is to extend mindfulness to the rest of your day you want to develop an expectation that you're only mindful when your very positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I do fully intend to use this ordering when I'm running low on
ideas but I shall limit it only to then. I'm glad I made the discovery
and intend to continually try new alterations and note the consequences.
So if you've got some daily rituals or routines, mix them up and see if
you can gain some unexpected performance gains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>GSD 2 — Retaining Focus</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/gsd-2-retaining-focus-98ffdabf2a75.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2013-12-27:/gsd-2-retaining-focus-98ffdabf2a75.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xmonad.org/"&gt;Xmonad&lt;/a&gt; - Xmonad is a Haskell based window

that plays music that apparently helps keep you focused. Personally I've found it quite effective. It pushes for 100 minute stints of focused work before taking a break. As a coder I'm a big fan of this. 25 minute pomodoros got really distracting and were a pain to maintain after a while. 100 minutes lets me keep my mind on whatever level of the coding stack I'm currently on for longer periods. Even focusatwill states that it can take 20 minutes to accumulate enough to begin focus. Plus, if you're skeptical there's a free trial period.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>GSD 3 — Keeping your habits in mind</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/gsd-3-keeping-your-habits-in-mind-ded639ef1e39.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-12-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2013-12-27:/gsd-3-keeping-your-habits-in-mind-ded639ef1e39.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you've removed your distractions and figured out how to maintain

Well firstly, read &lt;a href="https://zenhabits.net/sticky/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Don't jump head first into habits you've never gone through before. You're expectations will be too high and sadly, you'll likely fail. Patience is a virtue.
So, after you've chosen the habit you'd like to begin with, here are
some tools to help keep you focused on those good habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.amimetic.habits"&gt;Habit Streak&lt;/a&gt; - This app helps you achieve your goals with daily habit reminders. The focus here is on streaks. Define habits you can achieve everyday. Personally I find slightly vague is good. For example I don't intend to run everyday(you need downtime from running), so instead I have a habit to exercise everyday. So I alternate running with strength exercises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cron-Jobs - Yup, straight up cron-jobs are a great way to remind you to keep your good habits in mind. Make sure you have zenity installed and add this to your local cron with crontab -e. I also use cronjobs to automatically shut down my computer in the evening to prevent me working late and to properly wind-down ensuring a good sleep habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

week I do a fairly lengthy review of the last week. I see what habits
have been successful and which have been a struggle to maintain. I look
to see if there are appropriate alterations I can use to help improve.
Here's a list of the things I tend to analyse while reviewing, and the
questions I've asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/"&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt; - What have I procrastinated on this week? What peak times do I tend to be productive on my computer and when are the troughs? Can I replace this behavior with something slightly more useful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.habitstreak.com/"&gt;Habit Streak&lt;/a&gt; - This one I find very important. What habits have I maintained and what have failed? I ask myself in a gentle self-analytical way why I couldn't maintain certain habits and what conditions I can change to improve my chances. Maybe the habits are simply not maintainable? Do I need to stop others and make specific time for new ones? Should I change my schedule? Reviewing is key to maintaining habits like these and the app I use is really straight-forward, exactly what I need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep"&gt;Sleep as Android&lt;/a&gt;— Am I still maintaining a good sleep habit? Sometimes I try alterations to my routine and work out if there's a positive or negative effect to my day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Todo List -I just use a notepad and sometimes just dump ideas into Evernote. At the end of the week I collect them up and add them to a todo list or ditch them. Saying no and not indulging ideas you simply don't have time for it key to this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instapaper.com/"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; - I do some gardening to my reading list and dump anything I felt may have been a valuable read at the time but on reflection isn't. I have a tendency to throw everything and the kitchen sink at my reading list, so purging this down is essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gratefulness - I add in the things that I'm grateful for from the last week. Typically I try write these moments down during the week. It helps to re-affirm the things you find important and appreciate. By doing it and keeping the things you're grateful for in your mind it helps the review become a more decisive and straightforward process, especially when you have a tendency to hang on to those ideas or wandering thoughts that really have no value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects - What progress have I made in the last week? How has it stacked up compared to other weeks? Did I have a fluid week or was there blockers, how can I approach these if they occur again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacts - Are there contacts or people I've met recently that I wish to catch up or meet again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally this is a rough list of what I look at and I've found the
process very revealing and incredibly useful. It provides me with a
framework that has kept me focused on my longer-term goals but also on my general health and how I can potentially make systematic improvements in smaller ways on a regular basis. These improvements will accrue and the benefits over time can be phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Principles</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/principles-5cdc28ff6843.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2013-12-26:/principles-5cdc28ff6843.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Going to spend St.Stephen's day going over &lt;a href="http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf"&gt;Dalio's Principles&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I've gotten attracted to a very simple idea of "Just keep going". In my
head I imagine the Terminator, after being blown to bits, still getting
up. I suffer from "Goldilocks procrastination", essentially everything
needs to be just right before anything can happen. On top of that
everything needs to remain perfect for me to maintain it. On paper it's
insanely obvious that this will fail, but a lesson that's taken me a
while to learn. If I don't have all the study materials or if I miss a
run during the week and boom, never again. What's the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after a huge number of failures I'm moving onto my very light, very
simple "just keep going". No fancy todo list software, no complicated
GTD systems, no goal tracking software. Literally none of them have
worked for me, purely as I can't forgive myself for the small failures.
I want to wake up in the morning, pull out a notepad, write whatever
inspires me that day and do it. If I miss a run or am missing something
that's barely preventing me from doing my task, it's irrelevant. It's
the next opportunity that's important.&lt;/p&gt;

will be difficult, right now I hold down two jobs which sucks up a huge
amount of time, but by documenting how I'm progressing and the
techniques I use to maintain motivation and find time I hope it'll help
me and others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>For any active del.icio.us users I'd highly recommend…</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/for-any-active-del-icio-us-users-id-highly-recommend-d89cee8880c7.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2010-12-17:/for-any-active-del-icio-us-users-id-highly-recommend-d89cee8880c7.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pinboard.in" title="http://pinboard.in"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinboard: social bookmarking for introverts&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I use evernote as my brain online for everthing, it is

&lt;p&gt;Although I use evernote as my brain online for everthing, it is
incredibly useful for programmers too. Where I work things like
requirements can be captured on almost anything, so snapping photos of
whiteboards/notepads/beer mats that become OCR searchable is very handy.
On top of that it's nice to have all notes auto stored up on the web(I'd
have a fit if I lost my developer diary over a hard drive crash). The
client application for evernote could be better and I'd consider
Microsoft's OneNote a much better application but Evernote does
everything I need it too. The killer feature being the iPhone app that
lets me capture text, voice and snapshots everywhere. Coupled with JotNot it gives me a very powerful information capturing device that I simply cannot live without. This is one of the truly killer apps for my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does my hard-drive always die the evening I forget to push my code
up to the git server? Store all code/config files/documents up on a
server always. The benefits are stupidly obvious. It's soon after
this realise you can start adding free little tricks that you didn't
think possible. Another plus, I don't have a static ip with my broadband at home(dyndns doesn't work due to my isp's infrastructure, a massive mesh NAT) so &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5175362/start-bittorrent-downloads-at-home-from-any-computer-with-dropbox"&gt;here's&lt;/a&gt; a cool trick for easily torrenting(or in my case usenetting) files remotely. There's also something very nice about being all to pull up
any of my important files anywhere there's a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gmail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it rocks, despite Buzz.. Filters, label and keyboard shortcuts have made this such an obvious choice it's not even funny. I'd almost forgotten to add Gmail to the list it's become such an integrated part of my web-use. The programmer related benefits are dissimilar to general user benefits, but thing extended features like keyboard shortcuts etc I probably only of real benefit to the techies who are the only ones bothered to read up on these features. Other than that there's little to say, odds are I'd mostly be preaching to the converted anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stackoverflow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly a web-app but something most programmers cannot live without
and it's web-based. Arguably this could be number one , but personally I
don't use this resource as much as the above three. Have a programming
question, odds are insanely high it'll be answered here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Reader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all got to keep up with the latest developments in our industry.
Coding Horror, A list apart, trivium, proggit and Bertrand Meyer's blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also reader has a new feature that supports updates on sites that don't
actually support RSS(some might question the point in RSS with features
like this….). This feature's very handy for one of my favourite programmer sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mindmeister&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a hell of a lot of mindmaps for storing programming related
knowledge. Almost every technical book I read has mindmaps associated. I
like building mindmaps, it forces me to have a 2nd thought on the
content I'm reading and I have a less painless way of reviewing what
I've read. To be honest, mindmeister as an application isn't perfect. It
doesn't have folders or any decently readable way of labelling mindmaps.
Very annoying when you've got tons of mindmaps to sort through. I'd love
to say that the fairly expensive iPhone app makes up for this(not sure
why it couldn't be free considering it's a subscription based service),
but the app for me is almost worthless. There's nothing wrong with the
app in itself it's just not a pleasant experience browsing/editing
mindmaps on your iPhone. It seems like I'm singing the praises of
mindmaps over mindmeister itself but other than these few issues
mindmeister is a solid application. As it's online sharing mindmaps is
also a very handy feature. But if sharing/accessibilty
anywhere doesn't matter to you I'd recommend something like FreeMind for all your mindmapping needs, even keeping your local mindmaps synced on Dropbox could suit you just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pinboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinboard is a very nice online bookmark storage. Very, very simple
bookmarking/to-read lists, fantastically simple tagging features and the
ability to add bookmarks from emails makes this a great service. I keep
all my tech articles up on this service. For an extra charge all my
bookmarks become archived, meaning if I bookmark a site using pinboard
and the site in question goes down the page is still accessible from
pinboard forever. I could do the same using archive.org but having this
feature included in a bookmarking service really makes sense. On top of
that adding bookmarks from google reader, twitter, instapaper and
delicious really adds to the service. Highly recommended bookmarking
service for techies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rememberthemilk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the milk takes the simple idea of todos lists, adds a set of
complex features(due dates, repeating tasks, tagging, folders, sharing
and a lot more). Adds in the ability to add tasks from almost anywhere.
IM, email, phone(if supported), widgets for almost anything(including
gmail), and many apps that support it(tasque/gnome do for linux or a
dashboard widget for osx) and you've got RTM. Yet the application itself
never gets bogged down in it's complexity. 'Buy milk today' or 'Buy milk tuesday' or 'Buy milk tue' or the many other variants of dates and rtm
will likely be able to parse a date out of it. Other nice little tweaks like this makes RTM a great application for the programmer, as I mentioned in books like Passionate and Pragmatic Programmer Programmer there's a lot of 'Act On It's' some of them have different contexts, for example I might need to do a task weekly at home or do a task everyday in work. Using RTM to handle the adding of all these tasks makes things a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; easier. I also use the pomodoro technique with RTM, using the tagging features I add estimates to my todos (e1,e2,e3) via tags. On top of all the other programming related todos I intend to do(including this post!) this service has made life a lot
easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Grooveshark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's up for debate whether programmers should listen to music at work or not.
Personally I find music listening to music fine when I actually have to
code, but when it comes to creating a specification or stepping through
code listening to music is a very annoying distraction. When I do
listening to music I always use grooveshark. The UI leaves a lot to be
desired but there's a music selection that's 2nd to none, the playlists
are handy too depending on the mood you in. Feeling tired in the
morning? I have a wake-up playlist. Need some background music, there's
a playlist for that! All very painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NutshellMail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NutshellMail is a service that combines twitter, facebook, linkedin and
myspace updates into a single email that's sent to you on a daily basis.
I questioned whether I'd use this service when signed up but I've come
to love this application. I follow a lot of developers on twitter and
some through facebook and it's really nice to know your updates will
arrive at a certain time everyday. Instead of jumping on every few
hours, negatively impacting on my productivity, I have a focused time to
get myself updated on all the latest trends. The linkedin support is
handy too for keeping up to date on your professional news also. I could
have added twitter/linkedin to this top ten but at this stage I think
these websites go without saying(and they're not exactly web
applications in the obvious sense).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Pomodoro Technique</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/the-pomodoro-technique-540acfc74681.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2010-01-18:/the-pomodoro-technique-540acfc74681.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__is__0RWADKvxo3s4JL63AyQ.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, basically because it was a GTD technique that came off the pragmatic bookshelf so I figured I'd give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explanation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a very brief explanation of the technique. You have a sheet with &lt;strong&gt;Today's Todos&lt;/strong&gt;, each time you do 25 minutes
of work …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__is__0RWADKvxo3s4JL63AyQ.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, basically because it was a GTD technique that came off the pragmatic bookshelf so I figured I'd give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Explanation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a very brief explanation of the technique. You have a sheet with &lt;strong&gt;Today's Todos&lt;/strong&gt;, each time you do 25 minutes
of work towards your todos you mark a 'pomodoro' and take a 5 minute
break. You then clock up pomodoros everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then every morning you pick from your \&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;activity inventory\&lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;(an
unsorted list of todos), and pick the highest priority tasks, beside
each task should be an estimate of how many pomodoros it should take.
For exampleI had estimated 2pomdoros for this blog post. So when
selecting your pomodoros for the day you take your pomodoro average (sum
of all the pomodoros you've ever done divided by the number of days),
and don't add more estimated pomodoros than your averages. So for
example my average could be 11 and I could have 3 high priority tasks
each estimated to take 5 pomodoros each, well clearly I would have to
add 2 and find a third that only took 1 pomodoro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now clearly there's more to it(they have managed to get several books
out of it). What you log all metrics on is called a report
sheet, so things I log are completed pomodoros, how far off my
estimates were, how many tasks did I fail to do today etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How I use it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully commited to the technique both at home and at work. So in work I
have a large diary and some extra sheets, for my 'personal' stuff I use
a small moleskine diary to do the job. There have been dramatic results
on both accounts. In work I noticed a better structure coming around my
day. When people asked me for things I now always delay till I've
finished my pomodoro(the book explains how to handle interruptions),
then weight how important the new task was over what I'm currently
working on. I also find myself looking back very satisfied with the work
I've done for the day, a personal sense of accomplishment. On top of
that I like the fact if anyone did ask 'what did you do all last week?',
I could very easily give a breakdown on what tasks I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everything else discipline is key. I've even noticed myself
slipping the odd time. Say I finish a task in 20 minutes, the technique
calls for &lt;strong&gt;25&lt;/strong&gt; minutes of focused work, so you should now focus on
how you could do the task better or just improve on the task in some
way. This is fine depending on some tasks but some just can't be done
any better. Going to the bathroom also becomes an interesting game as if
you need to go to the bathroom you should cancel the pomodoro, very
annoying when your bursting to go 22 minutes in. But youdo begin to
relish maintaining an average of sorts. It's something you work towards
and try increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's flexible!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now however a problem has become apparent and this is where the
flexibility of the technique comes in. As a programmer I noticed a
'flow' that stops as soon as the timer does(that's the point), I've
noticed 25 minutes is not nearly enough time so, as a compromise I can
now alter how my pomodoro works. For this week I'm going to try 2*25
minute programming pomodoros followed by a ten minute break. I could
increase the time of the pomodoro itself (say 25 to 50 minutes) but I'd
rather keep it 25 (busy work such as replying to emails etc doesn't take
50 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kaizen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence the point of the technique is not the 25 minute burst is
actually something called Kaizen, meaning make small improvements
everyday. The constant reviewing of priorities and the daily review of
work done is the real value in this technique. I find measuring metrics
on your own productivity very powerful. If I find I'm doing more with
2*25 minute pomodoros, maybe I'll try 4 and take a 20 minute break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest I've actually found more use for this technique at home
than at work. With work there is structure to your day and deadlines
looming that will always motivate you. At home that project or that
programming language that you've wanted to do for months has no
deadlines and just doesn't magically get done. With my moleskine(and
calendar reminders) I've got a constantmotivator to get things done and
do them better next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can recommend this technique for anyone. To get started all it takes
is 3 sheets of paper(the activity inventory, the report sheet and
today's todos) and some willpower. The book itself is great and would
highly recommend a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decent &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/viewerurl%3Dhttp://www.pomodorotechnique.com/downloads/pomodoro_cheat_sheet.pdf"&gt;Online Cheatsheet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A//www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/cirillo/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf"&gt;free book&lt;/a&gt; written by the inventor of pomodoro(not the prag prog one I've read)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mindmap I've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one may read very strangely and how I do the technique may not work
for you, but the hats represent a different 'focus' and when my
productivity starts to wane imagining the hats works well. I would
suggest using the mindmap after reading the prag programmer book.&lt;/p&gt;
