&lt;div class="section" id="music"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The score is solid and the in-game sounds are fine but unspectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="story"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No spoilers here. The story isn't bad, but it definitely has higher
ideas than it's able to pull off. It also doesn't really capture the
language and cultural barriers effectively in it's dialogue or plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gameplay"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking around the pretty world is nice enough, but the motion feels a
bit clunky. The RPG elements are extremely shallow, and the battle
screen is unimpressive. There are sniper sections also which are also
fairly weak. All in all, it's not strong gameplay wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of language and cultural barriers ties into the gameplay too.
You enter new areas without the ability to communicate with NPCs, that
could really have driven home the message about language barriers but in
reality you pretty quickly find a translator and that's that. It could
have been interwoven into the gameplay further, for example
mis-understanding language could lead to some character mistakes
plot-wise, or it could have been woven more effectively in the gameplay.
Again, it's just a bit shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="did-i-finish-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I finish it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true estimation of if a game is decent in this bundle. So for me,
no, after playing for a few hours, upon returning it felt too slow paced
and clunky to want to continue. Perhaps the shallowness gameplay wise is
forgivable, I'd say give it 30 minutes, if you're not sold on wanting to
progress the story the gameplay may not keep you around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/2-billion-startup-github-could-be-for-sale-microsoft-2018-5"&gt;Microsoft has been in talks with Github&lt;/a&gt; about a potential acquisition.

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/2-billion-startup-github-could-be-for-sale-microsoft-2018-5"&gt;Microsoft has been in talks with Github&lt;/a&gt; about a potential acquisition. There are several reasons why this is a terrible idea. Github is a pretty solid git repo hosting company, but it has a few core values that are in jeopardy here and I'm not sure Microsoft(or anyone) can acquire an entity like Github without severe repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Platform agnostic integrations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github has a ton of super useful integrations that help make the life for developers a lot easier. Tools like appveyor, travis-ci, coverall, readthedocs, codacy are really useful and what's so great is you free to run them wherever you like. How can Microsoft make the business case to keep platform agnostic integrations that are aiding competitors? Maybe they won't ban them, but they may become very much second class citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't believe me? Some examples of Microsoft not giving a single crap about anyone outside Microsoft products..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having to use &lt;a href="https://tel.red/linux.php"&gt;Sky&lt;/a&gt; as there's no Skype for Business on Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.sunrise.am/"&gt;Sunrise to Outlook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7936081/microsoft-outlook-app-ios-android-features"&gt;Accompli to Outlook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certainly more examples, but the day I need to sign into a Microsoft account to use Github or can only deploy to Azure platforms for build tools, will be the day I stop bothering to use it and this is a real concern I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The connection to open source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github repos are by default open and if you wish to pay a monthly fee they can be made private, this alone has simply been amazing for open source and why Github has been the platform of choice for most open source projects. There's also a great issue tracker, wikis, support for markdown readmes etc. We've all benefitted from such a great setup for open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been doing good work in the open source space for the last few years, but anyone can see this is a recent development and purely for business reasons to regain much of the damage done in the 90s. When Microsoft attended Linux conferences they've &lt;a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/news/articles/low_point/column08.html"&gt;come dressed as Darth Vader&lt;/a&gt;, the dark corporate entity against the rebels of open source. Now they're planning to purchase the entity hosting the largest repository of open source code that has ever existed? If the strong connection to open source goes, the coolness factor takes a hit and so does Github's community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coolness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is not cool. God love them, they're trying their best, and I don't hate Microsoft at all. They've always given a shit about developers. I recently gave VSCode a whirl and was impressed. However, can you imagine Windows and Microsoft services getting hooked into Github all over the place? Collaborate with your open source developers over (ugh) Skype, auto-deploy your repo to Azure, or tie your Github account into your Linkedin one so recruiters can find more evidence you're perfect for that Java role because of some decade old Java repo from college. If anyone thinks this is insane I give you this monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__8tn6DDr1phm4CJnvPvr__0A__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, migrating to another git host(cough &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"&gt;gitlab&lt;/a&gt;) might be a bit of a pain but it's really not that much work, mostly because git is so awesome. So Microsoft is really going to have to play this one carefully. I imagine a lot of Stallman's army will leave the moment Github agrees to such an acquisition, in fact Gnome has moved to Gitlab as they feel it matches them &lt;a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/05/31/welcome-gnome-to-gitlab/"&gt;more in spirit&lt;/a&gt;. Can you imagine many open source projects aligning with Microsoft 'in spirit'? Open source as a movement naturally rebels against centralised systems, how Microsoft can purchase its way into the hearts of developers is a hard thing to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Update&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there's been a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-03/microsoft-is-said-to-have-agreed-to-acquire-coding-site-github"&gt;confirmation from Microsoft,&lt;/a&gt; color me skeptical. The best case scenario is Microsoft gives it the lightest possible touch. The question is if Microsoft's recent efforts with Github provide enough positive energy to maintain goodwill towards Github or if Gitlab becomes the de-facto FOSS git repo and let's be honest, the de-facto git repo hosting company of choice down the line.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Wild Wild Country – The Soundtrack</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/wild-wild-country-the-soundtrack-bbe397fc1cf4.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-29T20:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-29T20:16:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2018-03-29:/wild-wild-country-the-soundtrack-bbe397fc1cf4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wild Wild Country – The Soundtrack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom from the Known can be a tough book to crack, the lessons offered within are almost dismissed by the arguments made within the book, on top of that it's likely most won't be in a position to even accept what they read as they are reading it. Despite these barriers, there is still wonderful lessons here calling out our own values, our judgements and what is preventing us from being truly free and present in each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Authority&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishnamurti opens by trying to list out what are the things in life preventing us from true freedom. The list becomes more radical as time goes on. Here is a far from exhaustive list.
-Second-hand words, such as books which cause us to become second-hand people. A sort of circular logic here.
-Religious leaders and promise of something beyond this little life
-"That is our daily life and in that, there is no hope, and therefore every form of philosophy, every form of theological concept, is merely an escape from the actual reality of what is."
-Nationalism
-Tradition
-Pleasure
-Memory
-Fear
-Belief
-Relationships based on an 'image of the other end'
-What we should be
-Time -&amp;gt; "When I say I know you, I mean I knew you yesterday. I do not know you actually now."
-The observer/observed division
-Thought
This goes as far as "There is no guide, no teacher, no authority. There is only you-your relationship with others and with the world-there is nothing else." but even then we also need to dismiss the current 'you', "Forget all you know about yourself; forget all you have ever thought about yourself; we are going to start as if we knew nothing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krishnamurti spends a lot of time explaining what we shouldn't do, how we should not behave, the elements of this book that drive us towards what we should do are to some extent frustratingly brief. However this can be explained as 'showing us the path' as opposed to pointing out every bend on the way, but he might argue that there even is a path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lack of Sympathy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's arguable but Krishnamurti sounds like he believes not many are willing to change, "those who are fairly secure socially and economically or who hold dogmatic beliefs and are content to accept themselves and things as they are or in a slightly modified form" are left out in the cold. That leaves a lot of people out in the cold. Despite this, I would argue if you are in this position it's still worth pursuing this book. Krishnamurti does an excellent job of calling out the baggage each of us holds that keeps us from being truly free in his definition, and while he may argue that we cannot go in half-hearted, casting aside some of the things holding us back from a present without judgement is worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also argue there is a lack of psychological sympathy here. Krishnamurti's goals are painfully simple and yet incredibly difficult to achieve. His response is also to achieve these things in the immediate. Do it now, without much care for human psychology or the difficulty involved in re-shaping your entire worldview in such a radical way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The 'Goal'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's left after dismissing these elements of our own minds? In Krishnamurti's words, "What is important is not a philosophy of life but to observe what is actually taking place in our daily life, inwardly and outwardly." And "Freedom is a state of mind-not freedom from something but a sense of freedom, a freedom to doubt and question everything and therefore so intense, active and vigorous that it throws away every form of dependence, slavery, conformity and acceptance." There is essentially a psychological death that will free us to observe the new and to truly live. "To die is to have a mind that is completely empty of itself, empty of its daily longings, pleasures and agonies. Death is a renewal, a mutation, in which thought does not function at all because thought is old. When there is death there is something totally new. Freedom from the known is death, and then you are living."&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Friday Fun — Offline 8tracks playlists using Grooveshark</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/friday-fun-offline-8tracks-playlists-using-grooveshark-34b2512270df.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-07-25:/friday-fun-offline-8tracks-playlists-using-grooveshark-34b2512270df.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking about how they might offline their

favourite 8track tracks and I've come up with a rudimentary solution
while I was doing some offline coding. On 8tracks I've found a great
playlist series called Cold Machines created by user sowat on 8tracks and I wanted to offline my favourited tracks from these playlists as they're great for
coding to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there's no direct way to do this it's a several step process, but an
pretty easy one at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="http://8trackshelper.appspot.com/"&gt;8trackshelper&lt;/a&gt; to generate a plain-text copy of your favourite tracks, simply paste in your username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then paste the plaintext list into &lt;a href="http://groovylists.com/?do=plaintext"&gt;groovylist's plaintext importer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will create a temporary playlist which you can add to an existing playlist or create a new one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, download &lt;a href="http://groovesquid.com/"&gt;groovesquid&lt;/a&gt; and have it offline your newly created playlist.(Note: I could not get the Mac variant to run as it was damaged, I simply downloaded the jar file and ran 'java -jar Groovesquid.jar' via the command line to get it up and running)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only minor complexity might be if you have more than 200 songs,
you'll need to split it up when pasting into groovylist but that's
pretty easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>The Counterfeited Blog Post</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/the-counterfeited-blog-post-9d8f32f5d4b4.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-02-22:/the-counterfeited-blog-post-9d8f32f5d4b4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__FbR__Xju3pqCkl2d7OhLEFg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_the_Novel"&gt;E. M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel&lt;/a&gt; and in it I came across a discussion on the French writer André Gide, specifically about his book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Counterfeiters_%28novel%29"&gt;Les faux-monnayeurs(The Counterfeiters)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_the_Novel"&gt;E. M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel&lt;/a&gt; and in it I came across a discussion on the French writer André Gide, specifically about his book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Counterfeiters_%28novel%29"&gt;Les faux-monnayeurs(The Counterfeiters)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a merge of reality and fiction, Gide himself keeps a journal
of his life as he writes the book and appears to merge the two. The
writer is celebrated in Aspects for hurling himself into the novel and
for not being bound by the style at the time or "All that is
prearranged".
There's a good example of it in this passage. When brought into a
discussion about the book Edouard(who is Gide's representation in the
book) responds on it's subject. I suggest you read this passage but keep
blogging in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And what is its subject?" asked Sophroniska.
"There is none," said Edouard sharply. "My novel has no subject. No doubt that sounds foolish. Let us say, if you prefer, that it will not have 'a' subject.... 'A slice of life,' the naturalistic school used to say. The mistake that school made was always to cut its slice in the same direction, always lengthwise, in the direction of time. Why not cut it up and down? Or across? As for me, I don't want to cut it at all. You see what I mean. I want to put everything into my novel and not snip off my material either here or there. I have been working for a year, and there is nothing I haven't put in: all I see, all I know, all I can learn from other people's lives and my own."
"My poor man, you will bore your readers to death," cried Laura, unable to restrain her mirth. "Not at all. To get my effect, I am inventing, as my central character, a novelist, and the subject of my book will be the struggle between what reality offers him and what he tries to make of the offer."
"Have you planned out this book?" asked Sophroniska, trying to keep grave. "Of course not." "Why 'of course'?" "For a book of this type any plan would be unsuitable. The whole of it would go wrong if I decided any detail ahead. I am waiting for reality to dictate to me." "But I thought you wanted to get away from reality." "My novelist wants to get away, but I keep pulling him back. To tell proposed by reality, and the ideal reality." "Do tell us the name of this book," said Laura, in despair. "Very well. Tell it them, Bernard." "Les Faux Monnayeurs," said Bernard. "And now will you please tell us who these faux monnayeurs are." "I haven't the least idea." Bernard and Laura looked at each other and then at Sophroniska. There was the sound of a deep sigh. The fact was that ideas about money, depreciation, inflation, forgery, etc., had gradually invaded Edouard's book - just as theories of clothing invade Sartor Resartus and even assume the functions of characters. "Has any of you ever had hold of a false coin? " he asked after a pause. "Imagine a ten-franc piece, gold, false. It is actually worth a couple of sous, but it will remain worth ten francs until it is found out. Suppose I begin with the idea that — " "But why begin with an idea?" burst out Bernard, who was by now in a state of exasperation. "Why not begin with a fact? If you introduce the fact properly, the idea will follow of itself. If I was writing your Faux Monnayeurs I should begin with a piece of false money, with the ten-franc piece you were speaking of, and here it is! " So saying, Bernard pulled a ten-franc piece out of his pocket and flung it on the table. "There," he remarked. "It rings all right. I got it this morning from the grocer. It's worth more than a couple of sous, as it's
coated in gold, but it's actually made of glass. It will become quite transparent in time. No—don't rub it—you're going to spoil my false coin." Edouard had taken it and was examining it with the utmost attention. "How did the grocer get it?" "He doesn't know. He passed it on me for a joke, and then enlightened me, being a decent fellow. He let me have it for five francs. I thought that, since you were writing Les Faux Monnayeurs, you ought to see what false money is like, so I got it to show you. Now that you have looked at it, give it me back. I am sorry to see that reality has no interest for you." a pity," remarked Bernard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst reading this I couldn't help but think of bloggers in general.
Reality interests bloggers, it's what we typically write about. However
reality too sometimes puts us out. A lot of bloggers(myself included)
tend to write about things were really excited about, that's
understandable. Why would you write about things you don't find
interesting? The problem however is how we present our reality. People
tend to get a snapshot of things at the peak of the writer's enthusiasm.
So things become overly positive (or overly negative depending on their
personality).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may write a post about an incredibly productive trick I've found only
to find a month later it's stopped working. Or some step I took in
simplifying has ended making everything more complicated. Either way
we're still trying to pawn off a counterfeit coin as real and it's
something that should be addressed. These posts are snapshots in time

I had trialled this while out and about in central London, but failed at around 5pm, I was disorganised and feeling incredibly dizzy from the crowds and noise, so this time I planned ahead and did this from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10 PM Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a late dinner at the wonderful Chaat on RedChurch Street in Shoreditch. May as well have an epic last meal, right? The advantage of the late final meal was that I actually managed to ramble in from the street and only waited a minute for a table. I didn't over-do it in terms of food. I often get hungrier the next morning if I eat a huge meal the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9 AM Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ran a 10k. This is the part I'm a little apprehensive about. I'm doing a training program to build up to my next half marathon, which includes 10k-15k runs on Sundays. I'm always starving after a run(naturally), so I'm curious to know how my body will tackle this. I also figure if this is a trial fast I should trial it during real life conditions, which would regularly include running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10 AM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The post-run hunger has come over me, but the "breakfast" while not the most satisfying I've ever has taken the edge off. mL (1 cup) of green tea and 5 grams BCAA (branched chain amino acids) powder (or take 5 capsules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1PM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hunger cravings are on the up causing me to feel a little tender, but short breathing exercise and keeping busy seem to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2PM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been a vegetarian for over three years, why do I still imagine greasy burgers when I get hunger pains?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a cigar to help things along. Is that cheating?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2:30PM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning to get dizzy/spacy, the cigar may be the source. I've been using my standing desk and been walking constantly since the morning but now I seem to want prolonged sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3PM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you'd call this lunchtime, same intake as breakfast. It takes the edge off a little. Can't really sit still anymore, I'm just pacing around but feeling light-headed at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6PM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching movies at the moment which seems to keep the hunger at bay. It's very much hitting a wall then finding energy from somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9PM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailing an hour early and having a small cup of soup. Put frankly, I felt like I've had a temperature for the last few hours and all my body wanted was something wholesome in it, my resistance has totally fallen apart. I felt like I was coming down with an illness and I was worried the lack of food may have brought down my immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illness effect was probably entirely psychosomatic, but I did feel
terrible the last few hours, the light spacious feeling I had earlier in
the day turned pretty horrible. I'd like to repeat this experiment
without the 10km run beforehand and see how it goes. One thing is for
sure, I have a completely new respect for anyone who can regularly fast.
The ways in which this hit my willpower were completely surprising.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Review of The Woman Who Walked Into Doors</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/review-of-the-woman-who-walked-into-doors-7aec5acb710c.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-01-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-01-23:/review-of-the-woman-who-walked-into-doors-7aec5acb710c.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__6XmyAy6zsOLl0UDSPzgn1A.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I finished Roddy Doyle's The Woman Who Walked Into Doors and
I figured I'd write a quick review on it. It's a book on the life of an
Irish working-class woman named Paula who is struggling with an abusive
husband and attempting to keep her family from the brink that her
husband creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details in this book are what make it particularly excellent
writing. The lead character recalls incredibly specific details that
bring her tragic story to life. There's a few mildly absurd elements to
the book, but they're grounded in the unrelenting reality the lead
character describes. A chipped plate, the heat from a bag of chips on a
cold day, an attempt to describe the burning sensation of being
repeatedly kicked in the back. These elements are what kept me turning
the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build-up towards the end is also pretty incredible, the character
becomes whole in the utter despair she describes and the fortitude she
shows feels staggering. She's both incredibly vulnerable yet seems to
have no end to her strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the downsides of the book is that while you will eventually come
to fall for the lead character, her development takes a little too long.
For most of the book you'll feel constantly distant with Paula until she
eventually shares the true reality and despair of her situation. It's
not too much of a downside, it all pays off eventually and this downside
may simply mean the book needs a re-read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend this one to someone that can handle a harsh unrelenting
book. You'll be rewarded, but it comes at a price.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Legitimate ways to support good movies</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/legitimate-ways-to-support-good-movies-2fb11e565d2d.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2014-01-11:/legitimate-ways-to-support-good-movies-2fb11e565d2d.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__xU2KVV__mC4quGix9krfh4A__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

bunch of his movies, I'm a huge fan of Seven Samurai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Criterion Collection is a wonderful distribution company and I'm a
huge fan of a number of their filmmakers, so much so that I wanted to
try and support the service more. Since I live fairly lightly in terms
of possessions I can't really justify $40 on a DVD or Blu-Ray.
Especially since I'll probably have moved elsewhere and be forced to
ditch the media before I can watch it a second time.
It's a shame when distribution companies haven't really adopted digital
distribution. I am aware that Criterion is on Hulu(now something else), but unfortunately as I'm not a US resident I can't access/support it. If you are and can access it, I highly recommend checking out some of their movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I found a more old-school method to (in some small way) support Criterion movies. Near to where I work is a wonderful film-center called Close-Up that has a huge collection of both DVDs and books to rent. I'll definitely be making use of it for the time being.
If you know of another way I can access the Criterion movies in the
EU(or just without a US credit-card), I'd love to know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Happy Programmers Day!</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/happy-programmers-day-d14d9063b43f.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-09-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2013-09-13:/happy-programmers-day-d14d9063b43f.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy Programmers Day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been struggling with consistently writing. I find it
difficult to sit down in the morning and begin to write. Usually ideas
fall out of my head and I get into a flow quite quickly but recently,
without a clear idea sitting in my head for a period of time I simply
can't put pen to paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also just finished reading Charlie Brooker's article on "`Reducing
my word emissions" and I must admit some of his points are pretty convincing. There is a lot of noise on the internet and I suspect a lot of my unwillingness to return to writing is due to this.
I'm also working on a project similar to stackoverflow and I'm truly beginning to appreciate the format of the site. The internet simply has too much noise to signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try keep a hard limit on my posts of 200 words and see
if the limit can't help the writers block.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>South Africa</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/south-africa-c688b9070707.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-07-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2013-07-20:/south-africa-c688b9070707.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'd been in Cape Town for two weeks beforehand, just remotely working

and doing some sightseeing around the area. So I had plenty of time for
prep for the trip and was pretty relaxed arriving at Ashanti Logde(where
the trip starts). The trip was booked through African Budget
Safari's which seemed to the cheapest option around. The dates I had originally planned to travel with(and booked) were unavailable and ABS happily changed my dates and gave me a heavy discount(about 25%). On top of that I declined the free activities in Cape Town, so I was given free upgrade at Ashanti to my own room. So I can definitely recommend African Budget Safari's as an agent and also chance your arm and see what discounts you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met up with others on the trip and waited for the trip leaders. The
group was mostly mid-to-late twenties with two outliers in the
forties/fifties. Still an excellent result as I was worried the group
would have a much older average age. As I traveled I noticed the more
expensive tour groups had a lot of older people traveling and it sounded
like an awful time for younger folk traveling with them. I would highly
recommend finding out a rough average age of the people going on the
trip beforehand, our group was wonderful so living in each other's
pockets really wasn't a problem. However, if you get a bad group,
there's not a lot you can do for 6–8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group was 16 in total, about 8 of which were going the whole 42
days(and then some) to Kenya, so there wasn't a lot of swapping around
of the group. The trip is split into 3 main sub-trips(but there's
shorter trips within this also), so I was glad the group remained
consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually trip crew arrives, three guys from Zimbabwe. A chef, a driver
and the trip leader. It's usually those three guys, but we had a trainee
driver with us on this trip(to get his head around the route to
Zimbabwe). They all seemed lovely. We made out local payments and a run through the next few days was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I was sweating about was having access to local
money. How it was relayed to me was that I would need to have all of my spending money at the start of the trip. This seemed dubious as I really didn't want to have a ton of cash with me while traveling. The trip
leader alleviated these fears by explaining that there was tons of ATMs
on the way and you can take out as much Rand as you wanted as South
Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and most campsites in Botswana would all
accept it. I'd recommend getting a ton of Rand and don't bother with
Namibian dollars at all(it's a straight one-to-one currency rate so
there's no disadvantage and the Rand is more widely accepted). That
seems a lot less complicated. Make sure you have enough USD for Visa's
and certain activities, most take USD but some(like the Serengeti)
require it, try get this USD in Cape Town as they'll provide reliable
bills. You can get USD out in Zimbabwe but the quality of the bills can
be really poor and all countries(other than Zimbabwe), won't accept
dirty bills. Most people on the trip seemed to struggle to get money
converted in Cape Town, that they were residents or that they were
leaving the country in less than 24 hours. It's tough to find cash,
especially on a Sunday the day before we were leaving. However, I was
recommended a currency exchange place at the V &amp;amp; A Waterfront, that
would convert money. Make sure if you get Rand out of the bank to take a receipt to prove the cash you're bringing is legit. I didn't and had to
keep the Rand I'd just taken out and get more USD on my credit card.
Again, wasn't an issue as everywhere takes Rand, but just to bear this
in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the trip leader simply explained that the first few
day. A nervous feeling came over me when he mentioned 'It's okay, we
have a late wake-up. We just need to be gone by 7am'. I could see there
was going to be a lot of early starts in my future… So we were all up and out early for day one. We had a huge orange monster of a truck(not bus, truck) for transport. Bags, camping gear and tents go into the bottom, small bags up top where you sit/sleep/drink/live. Each seat had a personal locker where you can lock your stuff with, which was nice, but note that this is not available in all(or even most) of the trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were recommended to leave all valuables on the truck, money, passport etc. Our driver slept in the cab of the truck and the crew always kept it secure and I noticed they also keep their own valuables on there, so it certainly seemed a lot safer than on my person or in a tent. The truck itself was pretty chunky but comfortable, which is great considering how long you'll be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much ceremony we were off.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Overlanding</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/overlanding-ac775c297d46.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2013-07-18:/overlanding-ac775c297d46.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, for the last 6 weeks I've been over-landing from Cape Town to

Nairobi. I decided to ditch almost all of my tech for the trip. My
Samsung Galaxy S3 and my Thinkpad were replaced with an old school phone
and a notepad. I also picked up a tiny little Sandisk Sansa Clip MP3
player for the trip. For reading I had my Kindle and a few USB keys for
storing files and for Portableapps(which was a disaster I'll write about
another time). The decision for ditching was simply a need to be away
from the tech and connectedness. I'm in Africa for a reason, and I
simply didn't want the constant distractions a phone brings me. I
couldn't help but notice on the way others were clamouring for internet
when they thought it was an option. I appreciated having that option.
Anyway, as a result I have a lot of time to write with the long journeys
during the day and frankly I wish I had more information on the trip to
see where the land lies before starting, so I figured I write this blog
to give others a heads up and I've split things up into each
destination.
Here's the skinny on countries I hit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Namibia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bostswana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zambia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malawi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tanzania(and Zanzibar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kenya&lt;/li&gt;
