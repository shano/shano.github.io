debate the existence of God, desperately trying to reason out a
conclusive answer. The reality of this struck me while I was reading a
series of MIT lectures notes on arguments for and against the existence
of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture notes are very well written(so well written in fact the lazy
student in me probably wouldn’t have bothered going to the lectures, if
I had the pleasure of taking the course in question). The course does a
decent job of explaining concepts such as deductive and inductive
reasons and a few other philosophical instruments, but this isn’t the
source of my concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;question grates on whenever I hear it. Lets take a small village in
England, a shopkeeper has just been murdered and a crowd has formed
around the scene of the crime. The police chief arrives sirens blaring,
barges through the crowd, quickly scans the situation and declares “Did
Mayor Dave do it!?”. Everyone sighs, the Mayor is always blamed in such
cases. No-one remembers why the Mayor is blamed, it’s just what’s done.
The police chief along with his detectives then spend night and day
logically deducing if Mayor Dave is in fact the culprit. They always
come up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious problem here is the police chief has taken the entirely
wrong approach, simply by asking the wrong question. I hope you know
where I’m going here, but the obvious alternative is instead to declare
“Lets look at the evidence and follow where it takes us”. Why is this
approach not the same for the creation of existence? Why have we taken
only one, just one of the infinite amount of concepts, entities,
processes, whatever and decided to blow all our time reasoning about
this perfect being? A giant dragon by the name of Bill created the
universe, discuss. Why is this not getting the equilavent levels of
academic debate as Did God do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pointlessness of these discussions hit me when the MIT lecture
notes went into detail on the specifics of what theists and atheists are
reasoning about. Theists say God is Omnipotent, Omniscient and
Good(OOG), then the atheists spend time arguing that if this is the case
you can infer(eventually) that because there is evil God must not exist.
The theists respond with, ah but if the evils that occur were always
outweighed by the future good generated by the original evil act(and
this is guaranteed by God), then in essence the overall good is
maintained. My counter point here would be, if God guarantees all evils
are outdone by future good, isn’t it our moral obligation to always be
evil? But, I’m not going to be sucked into this rubbish debate. The
atheists have lost even by stepping into the playing field. I think
we’ve all forgotten that invention of God(I’m going back as far as
Dionysus here), was infact to counter a sensible lifestyle, to say screw
you to logic and reason and let emotions run wild. Two thousand years
later and we’ve forgotten this, blowing valid time reasoning about
effectively an emotional revolt against reason. Let the theists produce
all the reasoned arguments they can think of for God and when the exact
same argument doesn’t just as validly apply to Bill the giant Dragon or
the Flying Spaghetti Monster I’ll step up and listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then I applaud science and philosophers for at least attempting
to produce valid reasons for the existence of the world around us. It’s
an incredibly slow process, but at least it’s in the right direction.
One that’s lately caught my attention is the `Anthropic
principle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Descartes, Second Meditation</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/descartes-second-meditation-f5d3426ef9ee.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2010-09-20:/descartes-second-meditation-f5d3426ef9ee.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Descarte’s second meditation, he moves onto classification of the

mind and body. The initial argument is that he must exist, even if there
is absolutely nothing in the world he must exist, even if all existence
is presented by a deceiver, he still must exist to be deceived. He runs
into an interesting question of what defines existence and he
me. This is a good starting point, but doesn’t entirely answer the
question of self. For example, Determinism may entirely circumvent the
essence of self. He also seems to belittle the affects of sensory
perception. If everything I perceive through the senses is a deception,
are my thoughts truly my own or am I being led by a deceiver? Is my
definition of self as a thinking thing even valid? For example, Descarte
effectively defines imagination as “simply contemplating the shape or
image of a corporeal thing”. In essence stating that even imagination
can be corrupted by the deceiver. He closes off the imagination as
superfluous to perception of your own nature. Essentially Descarte is
cutting off any contact to the physical world, even imagination that
begins with a perceived event or corporeal object. However, the mental
acts involved in say sensory perception or imagination, these can be
considered real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually after repeated questioning he boils down to the reasonable to
“I am a thinking thing”. He separates the corporeal with the mental by
de-construction a piece of wax and stating, surely we cannot be
naturally aware of all states of wax, we use perception through the mind
alone. It is a mental cognitive judgement on the nature of wax, which of
course is prone to error. Descarte has built up the importance of
‘mind’, and more specifically judgements and understanding over say
imagination. He cuts us off with reality and predicates all
understanding of anything(real or not) with the self. So, in every act
of understanding we establish the nature of our own minds a little
further, where his reasoning for this is, I don’t know. Descarte draws
the line at comprehension so overcomes the deceiver argument. If a
deceiver gave me a sample of wax to play with, my comprehension of the
ultimate nature of this wax would be proof of self, not the imagining of
wax and not the physical contact with the wax. Essentially, the
foundation of all comprehension is ‘self’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I find myself agreeing with many sections of this chapter, it’s
never through Descarte’s reasoning, but purely I agree that they are
acceptable starting points. The question remains, I do not understand
the nature of existence, nor do I understand the true nature of
thoughts, yet we’ve made an inference anyway. Maybe the appearance of
thought is simply the motion of the deceiver, or a computing simulation
in action.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>Reflections on Descartes Meditations</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/reflections-on-descartes-meditations-a03fd614a3f0.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-09-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-09-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2010-09-11:/reflections-on-descartes-meditations-a03fd614a3f0.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I’ve just finished Descarte’s Meditations on First Philosophy and I’m

going to try put up a response to each Meditation in the next few days,
as well as the objections and responses Descarte added after the initial
six meditations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I whole-heartedly accept the I have the unfair advantage of about four
centuries of human advancement over Descarte, but I will try my best to
level the playing field. I’ll take each meditation as a separate
argument and accept(to some extent) all initial assertions Descarte
makes in each meditation. So for example in the second meditation
Descarte attempts to reason the existence of God and I’ll dispute any
flawed reasoning he uses, within this meditation. However, he uses this
existence of God to infer further claims in other meditations. For this,
I’ll accept(purely for arguments sake) the existence of God as a valid
assumption and attempt to dismiss again, any flawed reasoning he uses
based on this assumption. To be honest, it’s a testament to the extent
of Descarte’s doubt and refusal to accept but a few initial assumptions
that I can do this effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This for me is mostly an exercise in discovering if I can effectively
detect flawed reasoning and I’d consider Descarte’s book quite a
difficult one purely due to the abstract nature of the arguments(but
this may be purely due to my naivety).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Random"></category></entry><entry><title>The Museum-going Cannibal</title><link href="https://shanedowling.com/the-museum-going-cannibal-5d5bb1a3fbd.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-09-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-09-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Shane Dowling</name></author><id>tag:shanedowling.com,2010-09-11:/the-museum-going-cannibal-5d5bb1a3fbd.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the lastest issue of philosophy now.
