There are several reasons why this is a terrible idea. Github is a pretty solid git repo hosting company, but it has a few core values that are in jeopardy here and I'm not sure Microsoft(or anyone …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2018 16:39:57 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2018-06-02:/please-dont-do-it-github-5890eb72d12c.html</guid><category>Random</category></item><item><title>Wild Wild Country – The Soundtrack</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/wild-wild-country-the-soundtrack-bbe397fc1cf4.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wild Wild Country – The Soundtrack&lt;/p&gt;
