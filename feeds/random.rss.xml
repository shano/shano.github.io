&lt;h2&gt;Looks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love the art-style of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The score is solid and the in-game sounds are fine …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2020-09-28:/quick-review-long-gone-days.html</guid><category>Random</category></item><item><title>Please don't do it Github</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/please-dont-do-it-github-5890eb72d12c.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__cKz__YzMFvM1HgqvzbIBvzw__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/2-billion-startup-github-could-be-for-sale-microsoft-2018-5"&gt;Microsoft has been in talks with Github&lt;/a&gt; about a potential acquisition. There are several reasons why this is a terrible idea. Github is a pretty solid git repo hosting company, but it has a few core values that are in jeopardy here and I'm not sure Microsoft(or anyone …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2018 16:39:57 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2018-06-02:/please-dont-do-it-github-5890eb72d12c.html</guid><category>Random</category></item><item><title>Wild Wild Country – The Soundtrack</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/wild-wild-country-the-soundtrack-bbe397fc1cf4.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wild Wild Country – The Soundtrack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who hasn't seen Netflix's &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80145240?s=i&amp;amp;trkid=14170286"&gt;Wild Wild Country&lt;/a&gt;, I highly recommend you watch it. The story told, along with the wealth of footage they got their hands on makes it an incredible watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is also excellent, I've put together the soundtrack as …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2018-03-29:/wild-wild-country-the-soundtrack-bbe397fc1cf4.html</guid><category>Random</category></item><item><title>A Short Review of 'Freedom from the Known'</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/a-short-review-of-freedom-from-the-known-d22f52f8cdd3.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__jQR__j9gf6__MDS8XZSsef0A.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom from the Known can be a tough book to crack, the lessons offered within are almost dismissed by the arguments made within the book, on top of that it's likely most won't be in a position to even accept what they read as they are reading it. Despite these …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2017-10-13:/a-short-review-of-freedom-from-the-known-d22f52f8cdd3.html</guid><category>Random</category></item><item><title>Friday Fun — Offline 8tracks playlists using Grooveshark</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/friday-fun-offline-8tracks-playlists-using-grooveshark-34b2512270df.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have been asking about how they might offline their

&lt;p&gt;I've been reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspects_of_the_Novel"&gt;E. M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel&lt;/a&gt; and in it I came across a discussion on the French writer André Gide, specifically about his book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Counterfeiters_%28novel%29"&gt;Les faux-monnayeurs(The Counterfeiters)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I finished Roddy Doyle's The Woman Who Walked Into Doors and
I figured I'd write a quick review on it. It's a book on the life of an
Irish working-class woman named Paula who is struggling with an abusive
husband and attempting to keep her family from the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2014-01-23:/review-of-the-woman-who-walked-into-doors-7aec5acb710c.html</guid><category>Random</category></item><item><title>Legitimate ways to support good movies</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/legitimate-ways-to-support-good-movies-2fb11e565d2d.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__xU2KVV__mC4quGix9krfh4A__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I watched Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, after reading
through some of the Criterion info on Kurosawa I realised I'd watched a
bunch of his movies, I'm a huge fan of Seven Samurai.&lt;/p&gt;
