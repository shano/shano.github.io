News&lt;/a&gt;, I figured it
was worth a little guide on how I manage my iPod Classic on a Linux
machine. Thankfully some very clever people put together the drivers and
software to make this a breeze, but there's a few …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2022-02-26:/how-to-manage-podcasts-on-an-ipod-classic-on-linux.html</guid><category>Digital Minimalism</category></item><item><title>Consuming Content Like it's the 90s</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/consuming-content-like-its-the-90s.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It’s the 2020s, we continue to become more connected that we’ve ever
been, and I hate it! I don’t have the self-control needed to handle
these always-on devices. It’s awful. They’re all so incredibly powerful
and give so much in terms of information.

&lt;p&gt;I'm trying out a month of Digital Minimalism and I wanted some…
encouragement to ensure I stick to my rules. One of which is to use my
laptop only for specific tasks I know ahead of time, for an hour a day
only. I currently already use Activitywatch …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2022-01-03:/activity-nag.html</guid><category>Digital Minimalism</category></item><item><title>Make the smartphone dumb again</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/make-the-smartphone-dumb-again.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have terrible, terrible impulse control. I cannot stop using my phone
as a distraction tool. I simply cannot. We can discuss willpower, or
being a better person, but they don’t work. I have no willpower and
remain a terrible person despite how hard I try.

that when I follow numerous blogs there's a heavy noise to signal ratio
and eventually I get bogged down with all the blog posts coming at me.
On top of that I don't particularly like …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2014-02-15:/keep-up-to-date-b90ee98640d4.html</guid><category>Digital Minimalism</category></item><item><title>On wanting</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/on-wanting-8c4ca2f2d314.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__yqRgbrg76yhiaKeopwA06g__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I moved jobs and the new company I work for was nice enough to give me a brand new, high-end, retina Macbook Pro. It's a great machineand I've been reminded how great an operating system OSX actually is. Naturally, I've been looking at my own machine a little differently …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Shane Dowling</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:shanedowling.com,2014-02-08:/on-wanting-8c4ca2f2d314.html</guid><category>Digital Minimalism</category></item><item><title>De-activating facebook for a month</title><link>https://shanedowling.com/de-activating-facebook-for-a-month-f91b49da00a4.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/1__nNdLICwvbMSn__IhaHVHYRg__2x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll keep this one short, because there's a million and one articles about people walking away from the social network. People are writing like they're revolutionaries leading the mass exodus. I even poked fun at it in my &lt;a href="http://139.59.171.97/2014/01/25/internet-predictions-2014/"&gt;internet predictions&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I am aware, that while there is a trend towards smart-phones there are
quite a few articles around on the subject of people swapping back to a
dumb-phone or even &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5991495/why-my-iphone-is-better-as-a-dumbphone"&gt;using your smartphone as a dumphone&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently it can &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/10/31/why-i-dumped-my-smartphone-for-a-7-year-old-motorola-razr/"&gt;help your marriage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

many ways bring positive changes in your life. While limitations can
