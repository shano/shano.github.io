        <p>Deciding to become vegetarian is not an easy step. I decided to dip my
toe in the water at the start of the year by trying a month of not
eating meat, I would highly recommend everyone try this at least once
just to see what it might be like. I enjoyed the food I ate that month
so much I’ve decided to keep it up indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Personally, I chose vegetarianism after reading Peter Singer’s
“Animal Liberation”, but you may have your own sources of inspiration.
It’s a great book and I would highly recommend it to veggie/non-veggies
alike. It persuaded me to consider the idea of giving up meat and if I’m
ever drawn into an ethical argument about meat-eating I have some decent
arguments to fall back on.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to say that I’m a vegetarian purely out of
ethics but that’s simply not the case. In fact being honest I was being
entirely ethically consistent with regard to meat-eating, I would have
to go vegan and right now I find that a step too far. I’m almost certain
that dairy cows and egg producing chickens suffer far more than their
meat-producing equivalents purely due to their lifespan(the average meat
producing chicken lives around 8 weeks).</p>
<p>My real reason for giving up meat was simply boredom. I was bored of
eating the same things at restaurants using the same ingredients for the
same dinners. My relationship with food was a sort of thoughtless and
comfortable, but not interesting. Like I suspect it is for many. I’m
certain we could all make our dishes more interesting but I figured a
grand act would push me to try new things and it certainly has. I now
cook with ingredients I’d never even heard of. In fact before the switch
I would argue I could barely cook at all.</p>
<p>Vegetarianism is simply an inspiring limitation. Oh and also
<a href="http://zenhabits.net/how-to-become-a-vegetarian-the-easy-way/">zenhabits</a> has a really sweet list on why you should consider vegetarianism too.</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong> The question is, how do you keep yourself motivated in a world
of meat-eaters. One fun thing I do, is cook a new dish every week until
I have enough dishes that I like that I can keep cooking everyday and
not get bored. Each week just find a new dish that you feel like
making(curry, pasta-based etc), pick up ingredients from the nicest
vegetable shop(having nice vegetables can be key to keeping you
motivated) around you and cook. Some things will be great and some will
be disasters, but it’s all fun. Four months in and I’m already building
a great collection of recipes I find tasty. I’ve even started
my partner will eat, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong> I’m genuinely surprised how much vegetarianism has affected
me. For staters, when people hear about it they become incredibly
interested in it. Why do it? How difficult is it? Am I taking
supplements etc? It’s a great chance to try persuade people to do the
same, I usually try by explaining just how easy the whole thing is. Some
people have been persuaded to try a vegetarian meal once a week, I
figure after that they can make their own enquires into becoming
entirely vegetarian.</p>
<p>I’m a much healthier eater that I was before. Vegetarianism is a
limitation that increases reflection. As a result you find yourself
dwelling on everything you eat. For me, for the first time in my life I
have this mental checkbox that says, “Does this contain meat?” that I
had to ask every time I wanted to eat something. Very soon after another
question appeared, “Is this healthy?” and if it wasn’t “Do I really want
this?” and in most cases, I really didn’t.</p>
<p>Due to the constant questioning of what I was eating and the fact that
I’ve been trying crazy new ingredients I found myself getting much more
interested in my snacking options. We all snack and it’s something I
can’t forgo at certain points in the day. As I tended to find myself in
alternative food stores perusing random ingredients I tended to pickup
weird nuts or some dried fruit I’d never tried. My snacking has gone
from chocolate, crisps and jellies(I’m a real sucker for those), to
nuts, fruit and cereals. This really was a surprising effect and as I
had originally said to calm myself “You may not be able to eat meat but
at least you can stick with sugary treats if gets you down!”. It’s not
gotten to the stage where when I eat, say a chocolate bar I find it
tastes stale, unpleasant, cheap and for the most part all the same. I
genuinely do not miss them.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulties</strong> One difficult that will arise is social occasions.
Dealing with this is usually a matter of good preparations, but it
doesn’t hurt to have a few minimal ingredients dishes in case of a worst
case scenario. I’d flown home to see my family, who had forgotten I’d
told them I wasn’t eating meat and had thrown a BBQ as the weather was
nice. I went digging and found some potatoes, some vegetables, flour and
pitta bread in the back of a cupboard and threw together some awesome
veggie burgers(I’ll throw up a recipe later). While it didn’t stop
anyone from eating meat, most said they loved them and would have no
problem eating them as a substitute. I highly recommend them with sweet
chilli sauce!</p>
<p>There is also the cases where you will just crave meat, that’s almost
unavoidable. It’s a rare occurrence for me, but hangovers are my
kryptonite. I crave a fry in the morning but thankfully I haven’t given
in. Despite the obvious tastiness factor of fried meat, I tried to
figure out why a fry in question was such a difficult one for me to cope
with forgoing. I thought about it and realised that whenever I was
having a fry it was usually with friends, the smell of frying sausages
and bacon coaxing us out of our slumber and around a table chatting
about the prior nights silliness and wolfing down food. I realised the
subtraction of meat from this picture really doesn’t change anything at
all that matters. The point being that, if you stop to think about what
you’re craving you may realise that taste isn’t everything. Though it
also helps that vegetarian fries are awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong> I found when I first started looking for recipes I was
overwhelmed by choice. Eventually I came across <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/recipes/vegetarian/">BBC’s good food site</a>, which
is just decided to awesome food, that’s rated by users. It has a really
good vegetarian sections with some awesome recipes, I’ll share the ones
that have worked for me at a later stage.</p>
<p>I often find myself with a ton of spare vegetables where recipes have
annoyingly required two onions and I can only find a pack of three. If
you find yourself with the same problem try a recipe that’s very loose
with the ingredients. It might be a soup or a pasta dish with a nice
sauce, for me because I like to use quinoa and lentils in a lot of my
dishes I tried to find something that used both, with a lot of random
vegetables. Eventually I came across this <a href="http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=39142.0">recipe</a>, its super
healthy and really filling. I’d highly recommend a spicy pasta sauce
with it.</p>
