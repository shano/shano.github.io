    <p><a href="http://xmonad.org/">Xmonad</a> - Xmonad is a Haskell based window
manager for both Linux and Mac(sorry Windows users). It's highly
configurable but for me it's lack of features and application bar crap
is a real advantage. The application your currently working with takes
up the entirety of the screen and you navigate to other applications
using keyboard shortcuts. Using this and disabling notifications in your
IM/Email/whatever clients forces you to work on the task in front of
you. It's very pleasing to use after a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.focusatwill.com/">Focusatwill</a> - I've been a big fan of using the Pomodoro technique and I use focusatwill as an extension to it. Effectively it's a timer
that plays music that apparently helps keep you focused. Personally I've found it quite effective. It pushes for 100 minute stints of focused work before taking a break. As a coder I'm a big fan of this. 25 minute pomodoros got really distracting and were a pain to maintain after a while. 100 minutes lets me keep my mind on whatever level of the coding stack I'm currently on for longer periods. Even focusatwill states that it can take 20 minutes to accumulate enough to begin focus. Plus, if you're skeptical there's a free trial period.</p>
