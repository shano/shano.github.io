<p>I bought a <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated">book</a>, basically because it was a GTD technique that came off the pragmatic bookshelf so I figured I'd give it a shot.</p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>To give a very brief explanation of the technique. You have a sheet with <strong>Today's Todos</strong>, each time you do 25 minutes
of work towards your todos you mark a 'pomodoro' and take a 5 minute
break. You then clock up pomodoros everyday.</p>
<p>Then every morning you pick from your \<em>\</em>activity inventory\<em>\</em>(an
unsorted list of todos), and pick the highest priority tasks, beside
each task should be an estimate of how many pomodoros it should take.
For exampleI had estimated 2pomdoros for this blog post. So when
selecting your pomodoros for the day you take your pomodoro average (sum
of all the pomodoros you've ever done divided by the number of days),
and don't add more estimated pomodoros than your averages. So for
example my average could be 11 and I could have 3 high priority tasks
each estimated to take 5 pomodoros each, well clearly I would have to
add 2 and find a third that only took 1 pomodoro.</p>
<p>Now clearly there's more to it(they have managed to get several books
out of it). What you log all metrics on is called a report
sheet, so things I log are completed pomodoros, how far off my
estimates were, how many tasks did I fail to do today etc.</p>
<h3>How I use it</h3>
<p>I fully commited to the technique both at home and at work. So in work I
have a large diary and some extra sheets, for my 'personal' stuff I use
a small moleskine diary to do the job. There have been dramatic results
on both accounts. In work I noticed a better structure coming around my
day. When people asked me for things I now always delay till I've
finished my pomodoro(the book explains how to handle interruptions),
then weight how important the new task was over what I'm currently
working on. I also find myself looking back very satisfied with the work
I've done for the day, a personal sense of accomplishment. On top of
that I like the fact if anyone did ask 'what did you do all last week?',
I could very easily give a breakdown on what tasks I was working on.</p>
<p>Like everything else discipline is key. I've even noticed myself
slipping the odd time. Say I finish a task in 20 minutes, the technique
calls for <strong>25</strong> minutes of focused work, so you should now focus on
how you could do the task better or just improve on the task in some
way. This is fine depending on some tasks but some just can't be done
any better. Going to the bathroom also becomes an interesting game as if
you need to go to the bathroom you should cancel the pomodoro, very
annoying when your bursting to go 22 minutes in. But youdo begin to
relish maintaining an average of sorts. It's something you work towards
and try increase.</p>
<h3>It's flexible!</h3>
<p>Now however a problem has become apparent and this is where the
flexibility of the technique comes in. As a programmer I noticed a
'flow' that stops as soon as the timer does(that's the point), I've
noticed 25 minutes is not nearly enough time so, as a compromise I can
now alter how my pomodoro works. For this week I'm going to try 2*25
minute programming pomodoros followed by a ten minute break. I could
increase the time of the pomodoro itself (say 25 to 50 minutes) but I'd
rather keep it 25 (busy work such as replying to emails etc doesn't take
50 minutes).</p>
<h3>Kaizen</h3>
<p>In essence the point of the technique is not the 25 minute burst is
actually something called Kaizen, meaning make small improvements
everyday. The constant reviewing of priorities and the daily review of
work done is the real value in this technique. I find measuring metrics
on your own productivity very powerful. If I find I'm doing more with
2*25 minute pomodoros, maybe I'll try 4 and take a 20 minute break.</p>
<p>To be honest I've actually found more use for this technique at home
than at work. With work there is structure to your day and deadlines
looming that will always motivate you. At home that project or that
programming language that you've wanted to do for months has no
deadlines and just doesn't magically get done. With my moleskine(and
calendar reminders) I've got a constantmotivator to get things done and
do them better next time.</p>
<p>I can recommend this technique for anyone. To get started all it takes
is 3 sheets of paper(the activity inventory, the report sheet and
today's todos) and some willpower. The book itself is great and would
highly recommend a purchase.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>A decent <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewerurl%3Dhttp://www.pomodorotechnique.com/downloads/pomodoro_cheat_sheet.pdf">Online Cheatsheet</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A//www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/cirillo/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">free book</a> written by the inventor of pomodoro(not the prag prog one I've read)</p>
<p>A mindmap I've done.</p>
<p>This one may read very strangely and how I do the technique may not work
for you, but the hats represent a different 'focus' and when my
productivity starts to wane imagining the hats works well. I would
suggest using the mindmap after reading the prag programmer book.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
